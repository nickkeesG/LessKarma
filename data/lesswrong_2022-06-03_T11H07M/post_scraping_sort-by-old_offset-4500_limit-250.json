However we don't have good systematic ways of making predictions. We rely on pundits and experts in their fields, which might ignore changes in other fields.</p>\n<p>We are currently experiencing a period of low growth in the western world, so reliable economic growth is not an iron law throughout the world. So the projects and the organisations we start should depend upon what we expect of the future. If it unlikely to be a wealthy future for the sections of the world we are in or have influence over, we might do well to consider if we can do things to improve our prospects; our ability to shape the future depends upon our wealth.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>A lot of current discussion on lesswrong and research by institutions such as <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research\">FHI</a> is predicated on a high wealth, high tech, high energy society. But what happens if this doesn't come to pass? There is not much point discussing existential risk or life extension if the next 40 years has us scrabbling for resources to transition away from oil, coping with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/34941334/Will_Baby_Boomers_Bankrupt_Social_Security\">demographic transition</a>, and social upheaval caused by continued outsourcing and <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/09/07/rushkoff.jobs.obsolete/index.html\">mechanisation</a>.&nbsp;Even if concentrating on existential risks was the right thing to do rationally, it would be politically untenable and it might become a low status activity if there are more obvious problems.</p>\n<p>So it is not obvious to me that directly grappling with existential risk is the best thing we can do. It is currently neglected, but maybe the best thing we can do for the future is grapple with the problems in the 10-20 year time scale, so that growth is maintained at the current rate or a severe depression mitigated as much as possible, if one is likely. This would enable our future selves to have more resources to cope with existential risk</p>\n<p>I single out the 10-20 year time scale as problems on that time scale are not normally tackled by government or business, but we still have some inkling of what we will be dealing with. These issues are currently neglected as both entities have incentives to look problems at the 3-5 year scale and so may be ignoring low hanging fruit.</p>\n<h3>So what we can do to shape the future?</h3>\n<p><strong>Have a unified model of the earth</strong> - Everyone currently models the future, when making decisions about what subjects to study, where to live. They just do it in their heads, generally using snippets of ideas from news sources that ignore important issues. Even experts who model the future only look at certain aspects they understand. So we could integrate different peoples expertise into a coherent model of the world.</p>\n<p>So we should be able to improve on this. Perhaps a wikipedia-inspired approach might work where people are allowed to suggest changes to the model. Perhaps several competing models should be created.</p>\n<p><strong>Improving social institutions rationality</strong> - if we manage to create useful models of the future world, we can create charities and companies to deal with the problems we identify. However it will be important to make sure that the charities do actually solve the problems we want and don't become self-serving. So some experimentation with different <a href=\"http://brainworms.posterous.com/control-markets\">forms of control</a> might be useful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Creating technologies </strong>- the obvious one, which might include better methods of communication, collaboration or open sourcing the design of something to avoid too much control.</p>\n<p>While none of these things we can do has the force multiplier of creating a friendly artificial intelligence, they do have the advantage of being something that the average person can see the utility of so might become more mainstream and get more resources thrown at it.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018":

The theory is correct.\" While this may sound like arrogance, Einstein doesn't look nearly as bad from a Bayesian perspective. In order to even consider the hypothesis of general relativity in the first place, he would have needed a large amount of Bayesian evidence.</blockquote>\n<p><br />Discuss the post here (rather than in the comments to the original post).<br /><br /><em>This post is part of the Rerunning the Sequences series, where we'll be going through Eliezer Yudkowsky's old posts in order so that people who are interested can (re-)read and discuss them.

Papers are less likely to be published and to be cited if they report &ldquo;negative&rdquo; results (results that fail to support the tested hypothesis). Therefore, if publication pressures increase scientific bias, the frequency of &ldquo;positive&rdquo; results in the literature should be higher in the more competitive and &ldquo;productive&rdquo; academic environments. This study verified this hypothesis by measuring the frequency of positive results in a large random sample of papers with a corresponding author based in the US. Across all disciplines, papers were more likely to support a tested hypothesis if their corresponding authors were working in states that, according to NSF data, produced more academic papers per capita. The size of this effect increased when controlling for state's per capita R&amp;D expenditure and for study characteristics that previous research showed to correlate with the frequency of positive results, including discipline and methodology. Although the confounding effect of institutions' prestige could not be excluded (researchers in the more productive universities could be the most clever and successful in their experiments), these results support the hypothesis that competitive academic environments increase not only scientists' productivity but also their bias. The same phenomenon might be observed in other countries where academic competition and pressures to publish are high.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fanelli (2010). <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Fanelli-Do-pressures-to-publish-increase-scientists-bias.pdf\">Do Pressures to Publish Increase Scientists' Bias?

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_metro\">the subway</a>. The language might be a bit hyperbolic, but I was kind of on-edge last night. It seemed like it might be a fun story, I want to get better at writing, and gooey self-disclosure seems to be in vogue, so I posted it. If you don't like reading about feelings, then don't continue.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy,</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>I felt electric. It was as if my blood was made up of cool and charged water, chilling my bones as it energized my flesh, making me feel like at any moment my body could snap into doing something else. I got out of my seat, and lurched over to one of the hand holds in front of me. Reflecting, I decided that I would be in a more central position if I stood in front of the exit door, and my body swayed over there.</p>\n<p>My head was a bit foggy, but my path was clear. The outside world or my thoughts were racing by, but I could couldn't tell which. The girl who had glanced at me while I was sitting down looked up. I noticed a few other eyes glancing up towards me while I was walking, and felt like I was at risk for shattering into a bunch of pieces. I was ready for anything, but there was only one thing I was thinking of doing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Excuse me.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This probably sounds kind of creepy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But would anyone like to have a conversation?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The train stopped moving.</p>\n<p>I intended to look around, but I'm not convinced that I actually did. I wanted to have some time to see other people's reactions, but as far I can tell, I could only look at an oblique angle through the window that was above where I was sitting when I was reading.</p>\n<p>I had actually expected someone to say yes. I looked around expectantly to the side of people who did not fit my demographic expectations of a person who would actually say yes. A few went back to their distractions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Okay, no problem. Bye then.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I semi-purposefully turned around and walked off the train. My legs were shaking in the way they did back when I was scared of public speaking, my knees feeling like rounding errors in their control code was threatening to make them send my shin in all sorts of nasty directions, while the tensed muscles in my leg seemed to hold it all together. The world did not end. Weird.</p>\n<p>I felt like throwing up. Luckily, the sensation was blocked in my chest by a collision with some coldhot coming from my arms. They seemed to be really in control. My chest just felt sort of warm.</p>\n<p>A horde of thoughts about what I could have done differently accosted me. &ldquo;You should've focused on individuals, made direct eye contact no that would be creepy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why did you do this on a metro? People don't talk to other people here, just go to UMD or a party or something and you'll win so hard&rdquo;, &ldquo;I know you're proud that you actually followed through, but you should actually think at all beforehand to increase the probability of success&rdquo;, \"Come on it wasn't even that big of a deal, you just said something weird to about 15 people at once, I bet most of them didn't hear you anyway\". I thanked them for their contribution, and dismissed them.</p>\n<p>My heart sank a little, but not as much as my first rejection. My pride caught it -- I had done exactly what I had intended to do.</p>\n<p>I glanced around the terminal and smiled at a few maintenance workers. I sat down and pulled out my kindle.</p>\n<p>It was quite the rejection.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false,

This is wrong. Empirically distinguishable theories of consciousness have been around for at least 15 years, and the data are beginning to favor some theories over others. For a recent example, see this <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Lau-Rosenthal-Empirical-support-for-higher-order-theories-of-conscious-awareness.pdf\">August 2011 article</a> from Lau &amp; Rosenthal in <em>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</em>, one of my favorite journals.

These theories have featured&nbsp;prominently in recent debates on conscious awareness.&nbsp;We provide new leverage on these debates by reviewing&nbsp;the empirical evidence in support of the higher-order&nbsp;view. We focus on evidence that distinguishes the&nbsp;higher-order view from its alternatives, such as the&nbsp;first-order, global workspace and recurrent visual processing&nbsp;theories. We defend the higher-order view&nbsp;against several major criticisms, such as prefrontal activity&nbsp;reflects attention but not awareness, and prefrontal&nbsp;lesion does not abolish awareness. Although the&nbsp;higher-order approach originated in philosophical discussions,&nbsp;we show that it is testable and has received&nbsp;substantial empirical support.</p>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

Next, I turn to the input&nbsp;heuristics and biases, which &mdash; though they apply more broadly than just to reasoning&nbsp;about traits &mdash; entail further errors in our judgments about trait-possession. After that,&nbsp;I discuss the processing heuristics and biases, which again apply more broadly than&nbsp;the attribution errors but are nevertheless relevant to intuitions about traits... I explain&nbsp;what the biases are, cite the relevant authorities, and draw inferences from them in&nbsp;order to show their relevance to the dialectic about virtue ethics.

archive of academic journals, virtually all of which were behind a subscription wall. (JSTOR's been quite arbitrary about locking up its content; some of the papers it hosts are available at no cost elsewhere. For example, <a title=\"JSTOR's PNAS articles\" href=\"http://www.jstor.org/action/showPublication?journalCode=procnatiacadscie\">these papers</a> from the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA</em> are <a title=\"PNAS archive\" href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/by/year\">freely available on the <em>PNAS</em> website</a> but not on JSTOR.) Two days ago JSTOR opened up part of its database by giving free access to nearly 500,000 old articles. From <a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/news-events/news/jstor%E2%80%93free-access-early-journal-content\">JSTOR's announcement</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am writing to share exciting news:&nbsp; today, we are making journal content on JSTOR published prior to 1923 in the United States and prior to 1870 elsewhere, freely available to the public for reading and downloading. This includes nearly 500,000 articles from more than 200 journals, representing approximately 6% of the total content on JSTOR.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The announcement also refers obliquely to two related recent events &mdash; Greg Maxwell releasing a slice of old JSTOR material on the Pirate Bay (<a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/6rs/free_old_scientific_papers_link/\">previously discussed on Less Wrong</a>) and Aaron Swartz being charged for illicitly downloading papers from JSTOR en masse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I realize that some people may speculate that making the Early Journal Content free to the public today is a direct response to widely-publicized events over the summer involving an individual who was indicted for downloading a substantial portion of content from JSTOR, allegedly for the purpose of posting it to file sharing sites. While we had been working on releasing the pre-1923/pre-1870 content before the incident took place, it would be inaccurate to say that these events have had no impact on our planning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JSTOR makes similar comments in <a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/individuals/early-journal-content-faqs\">its FAQ for the new initiative</a> too. There's also <a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/support-training/help/free-early-journal-content-jstor\">a two-minute video demo</a>.</p>\n<p>(<a

However, if you try to write a computer program to simulate Thor and a computer program to simulate Maxwell's equations, one will be much easier to accomplish. This is how the complexity of a hypothesis is measured in the formalisms of Occam's Razor.</blockquote>\n<p><br />Discuss the post here (rather than in the comments to the original post).<br /><br /><em>This post is part of the Rerunning the Sequences series, where we'll be going through Eliezer Yudkowsky's old posts in order so that people who are interested can (re-)read and discuss them.

the Vital Statistics of the United States or other sources [<a class=\"cite-reflink bibr popnode\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163136/#B16\">16</a>]. <a class=\"fig-table-link

US data since 1900, which is generally similar to that of other developed nations. All measures of longevity increase monotonically for almost all years, providing periodic headlines and prophecies of impending crises. The real message, however, is that longevity gains from age 65 and above are quite slow and probably getting slower.</p>\n<p>...<a class=\"fig-table-link table figpopup\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163136/table/tab1/\" target=\"true\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Table 1</span></a> shows the average number of years of life remaining from 1900 to 2007 from various ages, combining both sexes and ethnic groups. From birth, life expectancy increased from 49.2 years (previously estimated at 47.3 years in these same sources) in 1900 to 77.9 in 2007, a gain of life expectancy of nearly 29 years and a prodigious accomplishment. The increase was largely due to declines in perinatal mortality and reduction in infectious diseases which affected mainly younger persons. Over this period, developed nations moved from an era of acute infectious disease to one dominated by chronic illness. As a result, life extension from age 65 was increased only 6 years over the entire 20th century; from age 75 gains were only 4.2 years, from age 85 only 2.3 years and from age 100 a single year. From age 65 over the most recent 20 years, the gain has been about a year [<a class=\"cite-reflink bibr popnode\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163136/#B16\">16</a>].</p>\n<div class=\"p\">Much confusion in longevity predictions comes from using projections of life expectancy at birth to estimate future population longevity [<a id=\"__tag_230996833\" class=\"cite-reflink bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20336136\">18</a>]. For example, &ldquo;If the pace of increase in life expectancy (from birth) for developed countries over the past two centuries continues through the 21st century, most babies born since 2000 will celebrate their 100th birthdays&rdquo; [<a class=\"cite-reflink bibr popnode\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163136/#B29\">29</a>]. Note from the 100-year line of <a class=\"fig-table-link table figpopup\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163136/table/tab1/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Table 1</span></a> that life expectancies for centenarians would be projected to rise only one year in the 21st century, as in the 20th. Such attention-grabbing statements follow from projecting from birth rather than age 65, thus including infant and early life events to project &ldquo;senior&rdquo; aging, using data from women rather than both genders combined, cherry-picking the best data for each year, neglecting to compute effects of in-migration and out-migration, and others.</div>\n<div class=\"p\">...Over the 107-year base period, the increase in life expectancy from birth over that from age 65 is approximately fourfold; over the 27-year base, it is less than twofold, documenting a flattening of the rate of increase in more recent periods (in the US). The &ldquo;Point of Paradox&rdquo; is the point at which the converging lines would cross. With the 107-year base, the Point of Paradox occurs in 2035 at an average age of 85.4.</div>\n<div class=\"p\">...Since 1980 [<a id=\"__tag_230996838\" class=\"cite-reflink bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7383070\">1</a>], we have performed similar calculations using data from many nations and many baseline periods and from different ages, with congruent results. The maximal average age ranges from 85 to about 93 years, with later base periods tending to be higher, and Japan and several other countries higher than the US We estimated the US maximum average life expectancy at 85 years in 1980, and now at 90 years. US White females currently project to 90.1 years. Thus, given generally stable trends, the maximal attainable mean life expectancy appears to be greater than 90 years and is almost certainly less than 100, far less than the 150 to 200 years still projected by some enthusiasts [<a class=\"cite-reflink bibr popnode\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163136/#B29\">29</a>]</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Related material is in Mike

you any changes that someone else has made to the code since then.&nbsp; You can never see what changes other people have made since your last commit, because to get the changes, you have to do an update; and the changes are added to your code without being shown to you, and a diff won't show them.&nbsp; So you just cross your fingers and hope their changes are compatible with yours.</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; That's ridiculous!&nbsp; Subversion doesn't do that.&nbsp; That would defeat the whole purpose of version control.&nbsp; That would be idiotic.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>:&nbsp; Really, it does that.&nbsp; I've tried it.&nbsp; Repeatedly.&nbsp; I've wasted days of work because of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; Nonsense.&nbsp; Of COURSE Subversion diffs against the repository.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>:&nbsp; Try this:&nbsp; Create a new file <em>foo</em> in your checkout in directory X.&nbsp; Then <em>svn add foo </em>and <em>svn commit foo</em>.&nbsp; Check out the same repository in directory Y.&nbsp; Modify <em>foo</em> in directory X.&nbsp; <em>svn commit foo</em>.&nbsp; Then do an <em>svn diff foo</em> from directory Y.</p>\n<p>[A few minutes later, after trying it:]</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; Well, of COURSE Subversion doesn't diff against the repository.&nbsp; It's meant for large, distributed projects.&nbsp; You wouldn't want to have to do diffs over the web.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>:&nbsp; Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; It would be too slow.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>:&nbsp; You do checkouts and commits and updates over the web.&nbsp; Are they too slow?</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; You want to diff against your previous version.&nbsp; It would be too confusing to see the changes other people have made, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>:&nbsp; Three minutes ago you said it would be idiotic not to diff against the repository.</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; Look, Subversion is an industry standard!</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>:&nbsp; Subversion doesn't even let you tag releases.</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; Of COURSE Subversion lets you tag releases.</p>\n<p>[Conversation eventually ends with Other explaining why you don't need to tag releases anyway.]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[P.S. - There is a very long syntax for svn diff that lets you specify full paths to the repository and your checkout directory.&nbsp; It can't mix paths and URLs, so you have to specify your checkout directory as a complete URL.&nbsp; No one that I know uses this syntax.]</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

"authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 1186, "htmlBody": "<p>As I've probably mentioned elsewhere, I am currently studying nursing. My third year started off with a bang today: a six-hour workshop on communication skills to prepare us for our month-long psychiatric/mental health placement, scheduled for October.</p>\n<p>The workshop would have been a lot more useful if we&rsquo;d, for example, done role-playing scenarios instead of watching a series of PowerPoint presentations. Like most of the skills involved in nursing, and like many of the skills involved in rationality, communication skills aren't well transmitted by book learning. The specific techniques we are supposed to learn are for \"therapeutic communication\", as opposed to \"non-therapeutic communication\". However, my first impression, as someone who has always found social skills a little bit challenging, was \"wow! This is something I can use \"all the time!\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Good Communication Techniques </strong></p>\n<p>One of the major skills that we've talked about in class, and tried to practice in our hospital placements, is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">active listening</span>: trying to really listen to what a person is saying and, maybe more importantly, appearing as though you're really listening. I'm sure that to some people, the non-verbal, body-language half of this is as automatic as breathing. It wasn't obvious to me. However, here is a helpful acronym from <a href=\"http://www.nursingplanet.com/pn/therapeutic_communication.html\">this site</a>. &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sit squarely facing the client.</li>\n<li>Observe an open posture.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Lean forward toward the client.</li>\n<li>Establish eye contact.</li>\n<li>Relax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The verbal half of this is: don't interpret and don't interrupt. Nod and use filler words like \"uh-huh\" and \"yeah\" to show that you're still paying attention. If they seem stuck or blocked, repeat their last sentence with \"and then?\" or encourage them with \"go on...\" or \"I'm listening\" The goal is to accept what they are saying and listen without criticizing or judging, whether or not you agree. Pretty much everyone likes to be listened to, and prefers it if their listener is attentive. I've been practicing this with my friends and family. Not quite to the point that it's automatic, but I have a reputation as a good listener.</p>\n<p>There are a few other techniques that I've tried to work on and that seem to improve the quality of my general communication. If a person's train of thought doesn't make sense to you, or if their explanation seems muddled and overly complicated, use&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">clarification</span>: try to explain what you think they mean in your own words, and see if they agree.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Focusing</span>&nbsp;is another technique: if you would really like to understand one particular point that they&rsquo;ve passed over, then bring the conversation back to that point. (&ldquo;Can you tell me more about X&hellip;?&rdquo;).&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Exploring&nbsp;</span>is similar, but encourages someone to broaden rather than narrowing the scope of their argument. At the end of the conversation, you can&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">restate</span>&nbsp;their points and yours. This is a good way to make sure that every thread of the conversation was followed up and that the meaning they took from your arguments is the same meaning that you intended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong> Bad Communication Techniques </strong></p>\n<p>There is a time and a place for&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">approving or disapproving</span>. There are plenty of times and places when doing will only hold up the conversation and distract from the actual topic. As a rule, I try not to openly disapprove of anything a casual friend or acquaintance tells me in conversation. Even if I really want to. It doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>help</em>. Casual acquaintances don&rsquo;t care enough about my opinion to stop doing something that I disapprove of, and most people have an instant &ldquo;dislike&rdquo; reaction towards anyone who criticizes them, even if they try to compensate for it. Some of my closer friends will actually listen to my disapproval and update on it, but when it comes to my best friend, I&rsquo;ve learned that she will almost&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>respond defensively.</p>\n<p>Yes, it's annoying. Yes, it&rsquo;s irrational that people respond this way. It&rsquo;s the way things are. In my best friend&rsquo;s case, I really do wish she would exercise more and eat a healthier diet, but I put a higher value on being friends with her than on making her change her lifestyle. And there are gentler, more positive ways to point this out to her. Most people&nbsp;<em>know&nbsp;</em>about their problems, and likely spend their time trying to avoid thinking about them. Passing judgement really, really doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>\n<p>This surprised me, but &ldquo;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">why?</span>&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>is generally not a good question to ask, at least not when the topic is someone&rsquo;s emotions or personal life. I think it&rsquo;s because, to a lot of people, emotions just&nbsp;<em>are</em>. They feel less like part of the mind and more like part of the environment. Asking one of these people &ldquo;why are you upset about Bob and Sue&rsquo;s divorce?&rdquo;, especially in a demanding-an-answer sort of<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>voice, is less likely to produce a calmly reasoned explanation, and more likely a defensive &ldquo;I just&nbsp;<em>am</em>!&rdquo; and a strong feeling of not being listened to. Again, this is kind of annoying, especially because I always found&nbsp;<em>why&nbsp;</em>to be a neutral word. But there are more neutral ways to fulfill your curiosity: &ldquo;Obviously this is important to you. Do you think you can tell me more about it?&rdquo; No way to take offense from that.</p>\n<p>The other examples of bad techniques in our textbook that I&rsquo;ve found applicable in real life are:&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">changing the subject</span>,&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">false reassurance</span>, and using&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">stereotyped</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">clich&eacute;d</span>&nbsp;comments to steer a conversation away from whatever it is you want to avoid. Yeah, sometimes my friends talk about things that make me uncomfortable, that scare me, or that I just don&rsquo;t care that much about, but&nbsp;<em>they&nbsp;</em>care. I owe it to them to listen attentively, whether or not I have anything useful to add. I try to extend that courtesy to acquaintances, too, since in some ways it benefits&nbsp;<em>me</em>: anything that makes me uncomfortable is probably a topic I can learn more about.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong> Application to Rationality and Winning </strong></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve found it much easier to help people change their minds (as opposed to&nbsp;<em>making&nbsp;</em>them change their minds) since I started following these simple rules. Almost everyone will learn more by focusing on their own arguments and finding the flaws than from having those flaws pointed out in a disapproving manner. And the level of enjoyment I get from day-to-day conversation and small talk has&nbsp;<em>definitely&nbsp;</em>risen. I might be able to say whatever I think to my parents or my brother and expect a reasoned and interesting response, but most people aren&rsquo;t as obliging, and if I&rsquo;m going to be sitting in the pool office at work anyway, I might as well hone my social skills and not be bored.</p>\n<p>As I said before, I expect these skills come naturally to a lot of people, at least when they&rsquo;re talking to someone who they like. I try to communicate in the same way with people I like and people I dislike, since learning more about someone&rsquo;s life generally means I will stop disliking them (and if they disliked me, they will like me more when I am trying to be my nicest possible self). Since enemies aren&rsquo;t something I like to cultivate, this is always a good thing.</p>\n<p>In short: being a good conversation partner is useful, whether you want to change people's minds or just have fun, and being a better listener will help with that goal.&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false,

false, "tableOfContents": {"html": "<p>As I've probably mentioned elsewhere, I am currently studying nursing. My third year started off with a bang today: a six-hour workshop on communication skills to prepare us for our month-long psychiatric/mental health placement, scheduled for October.</p>\n<p>The workshop would have been a lot more useful if we\u2019d, for example, done role-playing scenarios instead of watching a series of PowerPoint presentations. Like most of the skills involved in nursing, and like many of the skills involved in rationality, communication skills aren't well transmitted by book learning. The specific techniques we are supposed to learn are for \"therapeutic communication\", as opposed to \"non-therapeutic communication\". However, my first impression, as someone who has always found social skills a little bit challenging, was \"wow! This is something I can use \"all the time!\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Good_Communication_Techniques_\">Good Communication Techniques </strong></p>\n<p>One of the major skills that we've talked about in class, and tried to practice in our hospital placements, is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">active listening</span>: trying to really listen to what a person is saying and, maybe more importantly, appearing as though you're really listening. I'm sure that to some people, the non-verbal, body-language half of this is as automatic as breathing. It wasn't obvious to me. However, here is a helpful acronym from <a href=\"http://www.nursingplanet.com/pn/therapeutic_communication.html\">this site</a>. &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sit squarely facing the client.</li>\n<li>Observe an open posture.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Lean forward toward the client.</li>\n<li>Establish eye contact.</li>\n<li>Relax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The verbal half of this is: don't interpret and don't interrupt. Nod and use filler words like \"uh-huh\" and \"yeah\" to show that you're still paying attention. If they seem stuck or blocked, repeat their last sentence with \"and then?\" or encourage them with \"go on...\" or \"I'm listening\" The goal is to accept what they are saying and listen without criticizing or judging, whether or not you agree. Pretty much everyone likes to be listened to, and prefers it if their listener is attentive. I've been practicing this with my friends and family. Not quite to the point that it's automatic, but I have a reputation as a good listener.</p>\n<p>There are a few other techniques that I've tried to work on and that seem to improve the quality of my general communication. If a person's train of thought doesn't make sense to you, or if their explanation seems muddled and overly complicated, use&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">clarification</span>: try to explain what you think they mean in your own words, and see if they agree.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Focusing</span>&nbsp;is another technique: if you would really like to understand one particular point that they\u2019ve passed over, then bring the conversation back to that point. (\u201cCan you tell me more about X\u2026?\u201d).&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Exploring&nbsp;</span>is similar, but encourages someone to broaden rather than narrowing the scope of their argument. At the end of the conversation, you can&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">restate</span>&nbsp;their points and yours. This is a good way to make sure that every thread of the conversation was followed up and that the meaning they took from your arguments is the same meaning that you intended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Bad_Communication_Techniques_\"> Bad Communication Techniques </strong></p>\n<p>There is a time and a place for&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">approving or disapproving</span>. There are plenty of times and places when doing will only hold up the conversation and distract from the actual topic. As a rule, I try not to openly disapprove of anything a casual friend or acquaintance tells me in conversation. Even if I really want to. It doesn\u2019t&nbsp;<em>help</em>. Casual acquaintances don\u2019t care enough about my opinion to stop doing something that I disapprove of, and most people have an instant \u201cdislike\u201d reaction towards anyone who criticizes them, even if they try to compensate for it. Some of my closer friends will actually listen to my disapproval and update on it, but when it comes to my best friend, I\u2019ve learned that she will almost&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>respond defensively.</p>\n<p>Yes, it's annoying. Yes, it\u2019s irrational that people respond this way. It\u2019s the way things are. In my best friend\u2019s case, I really do wish she would exercise more and eat a healthier diet, but I put a higher value on being friends with her than on making her change her lifestyle. And there are gentler, more positive ways to point this out to her. Most people&nbsp;<em>know&nbsp;</em>about their problems, and likely spend their time trying to avoid thinking about them. Passing judgement really, really doesn\u2019t help.</p>\n<p>This surprised me, but \u201c<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">why?</span>\u201d&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>is generally not a good question to ask, at least not when the topic is someone\u2019s emotions or personal life. I think it\u2019s because, to a lot of people, emotions just&nbsp;<em>are</em>. They feel less like part of the mind and more like part of the environment. Asking one of these people \u201cwhy are you upset about Bob and Sue\u2019s divorce?\u201d, especially in a demanding-an-answer sort of<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>voice, is less likely to produce a calmly reasoned explanation, and more likely a defensive \u201cI just&nbsp;<em>am</em>!\u201d and a strong feeling of not being listened to. Again, this is kind of annoying, especially because I always found&nbsp;<em>why&nbsp;</em>to be a neutral word. But there are more neutral ways to fulfill your curiosity: \u201cObviously this is important to you. Do you think you can tell me more about it?\u201d No way to take offense from that.</p>\n<p>The other examples of bad techniques in our textbook that I\u2019ve found applicable in real life are:&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">changing the subject</span>,&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">false reassurance</span>, and using&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">stereotyped</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">clich\u00e9d</span>&nbsp;comments to steer a conversation away from whatever it is you want to avoid. Yeah, sometimes my friends talk about things that make me uncomfortable, that scare me, or that I just don\u2019t care that much about, but&nbsp;<em>they&nbsp;</em>care. I owe it to them to listen attentively, whether or not I have anything useful to add. I try to extend that courtesy to acquaintances, too, since in some ways it benefits&nbsp;<em>me</em>: anything that makes me uncomfortable is probably a topic I can learn more about.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Application_to_Rationality_and_Winning_\"> Application to Rationality and Winning </strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve found it much easier to help people change their minds (as opposed to&nbsp;<em>making&nbsp;</em>them change their minds) since I started following these simple rules. Almost everyone will learn more by focusing on their own arguments and finding the flaws than from having those flaws pointed out in a disapproving manner. And the level of enjoyment I get from day-to-day conversation and small talk has&nbsp;<em>definitely&nbsp;</em>risen. I might be able to say whatever I think to my parents or my brother and expect a reasoned and interesting response, but most people aren\u2019t as obliging, and if I\u2019m going to be sitting in the pool office at work anyway, I might as well hone my social skills and not be bored.</p>\n<p>As I said before, I expect these skills come naturally to a lot of people, at least when they\u2019re talking to someone who they like. I try to communicate in the same way with people I like and people I dislike, since learning more about someone\u2019s life generally means I will stop disliking them (and if they disliked me, they will like me more when I am trying to be my nicest possible self). Since enemies aren\u2019t something I like to cultivate, this is always a good thing.</p>\n<p>In short: being a good conversation partner is useful, whether you want to change people's minds or just have fun, and being a better listener will help with that goal.&nbsp;</p>", "sections": [{"title": "Good Communication Techniques ", "anchor": "Good_Communication_Techniques_", "level": 1}, {"title":

I don't think they're actually understandable as is</span>&mdash;<span>they're definitely not formal and there isn't an actual underlying formalism I'm referring to, just commonly held intuitions. Or at least intuitions commonly held by me. Ahem. But anyway I figure it's worth a shot.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The following&rsquo;s a brief over-abstract hint at the theoretical reasoning style that replaced naive anthropics a few years ago, ushered in by the development of updateless-like decision theories which are incredibly inchoate but widely considered a step in a direction that is at the very least rather appealing: &ldquo;Anthropic&rdquo;-like &ldquo;explanations&rdquo;, as exampled in my original status update, can be generalized to give the now-fundamental &lsquo;relative significances&rsquo; for all decision theoretically relevant self-dependent processes&mdash;but for humans only as determined by some self-unknown decision policy, or in other words derived from some provably imperfectly self-known &ldquo;true&rdquo; &ldquo;preferences&rdquo;/&rdquo;values&rdquo;/&rdquo;morality&rdquo;. This preference-centered decision policy can easily refer to some superficially-\"objective\" relative existence measure like probability, and thus humans can use Bayes &amp; EU as an approximation that is sorta mathematically sound&mdash;that is, until the humans start bothering to pay much attention to their infinitely many different contexts and correlated algorithms, each of which might split differently and mess up the calculations. If even as a human you insist on thinking about these &ldquo;copies&rdquo; then Bayes quickly becomes meaningless, and you&rsquo;ll need to start thinking in terms of decision theory.&nbsp;<br /><br />([I suspect that an attempt at sane moral reasoning for mere humans must indeed take into account logical correlations with the infinity of Platonic algorithms&mdash;but trying to guess at which Platonic algorithm one is &ldquo;truly&rdquo; using to make a decision can be immediately recognized as futile by anyone who takes a moment to reflect on any non-trivial decision of their own. Often it&rsquo;s not clear where to go from there besides looking for different ways of abstracting your decision rule to see if all abstractions exhibit certain stable features&mdash;you can thus say you&rsquo;re deciding to at least some extent for some algorithms that exhibit those features, but that amount of correlation seems awfully weak. (But if the features are rare, does that matter? I&rsquo;ve yet to think carefully on these matters.) In general humans aren't even close to being able to reason straightforward-causally, let alone timelessly.<br /><br />Interestingly Eliezer Yudkowsky has talked about this discorrelation as being a limited resource, specifically for agents that aren&rsquo;t as self-opaque as humans: at some point your Platonic decision algorithm and other agents&rsquo; Platonic decision algorithms will start to overlap a little bit, and insofar as they overlap they logically just can&rsquo;t not make a correlated decision. This makes it easier for each algorithm to predict the other, which can be good, bad, or hilarious, depending on the non-specified aspects of the agents. Perhaps we humans should value our unique utter inability to introspect?])<br /><br />You might wonder: what if &ldquo;your&rdquo; decisions are relevant (&ldquo;significant&rdquo;) for some &ldquo;other&rdquo; agent that doesn&rsquo;t share &ldquo;your&rdquo; &ldquo;actual&rdquo; &ldquo;values&rdquo;? The answer can only be that the same copies-ambivalent reasoning applies here too. Without the scare quotes, you can technically be a part of some other agent&rsquo;s decision algorithm just as much as your naive decision algorithm&mdash;you can even switch perspectives right now and think of yourself as some fragment of a larger agent, much like many normal folk identify as Soldiers, Buddhists, Humans, or all of those at once, as well as thinking of themselves as themselves. More intuitively you can think of yourself not just as yourself but as the source of inspiration for everyone else's models of you&mdash;models that tend to be <em>very</em> lossy due to economic reasons. Even a superintelligence might not bother to model you very carefully if it has other shit to do (e.g. modeling all possible variations on Babyeaters given increasingly improbable assumed evolutionary lineages).&nbsp;Thus the rules say you can be a pawn in many games at once, as long as multiple processes have a vested interested in you, which they assuredly do. And as previously shown, they&rsquo;re obviously allowed to be overlapping and at varying levels of abstraction and organization: A forgiving ontology to be sure, but a nightmare for finding Schelling focal points!</p>\n<p>One neat way this all adds up to normality is that by the time you find any such outlandish decision theoretic &ldquo;explanations&rdquo; for finding yourself as you somewhat compelling, you already have a lot of reason to think you&rsquo;re life is unusually influential, and that evidence screens off any additional &ldquo;anthropic&rdquo; update. You&rsquo;re about as important to you-dependent structures as you think you are, given straightforward causal evidence, and finding yourself as a you-like structure shouldn&rsquo;t cause you to update on top of that. This same reasoning applies to the original motivator for all this madness, anthropic probabilities: I have yet to see any anthropics problem that involves <em>actually</em> necessary updates and not simply <em>counterfactually</em> necessary belief updates&mdash;updates made in counterfactual worlds which would have been accompanied by their own non-anthropic evidence. [I think this is important and deserves fleshing out but I won't feel justified in doing so until I have a formalism to back me up.] And these days I tend to just facepalm when someone suggests I use &ldquo;human beings&rdquo; as my \"reference class\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A proposal to <del></del><del>rationalize</del> derive magick and miracles from updateless-like decision theoretic assumptions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Born rule should be derived from timelessness-cognizant game theory for multipartite systems in order to find equilibria from first principles. Deriving it from causal decision theory is clearly circular and Platonic-truth-ignoring &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t rationality anyway. I suspect that the Born rule is generally self-similar across levels of organization but is mostly an approximation/baseline/Schelling-focal-point for influence-influencing systems with gradiently influential decision policies in something like a not-necessarily-timeful Bayesian game.</p>\n<p>You can intuitively model this with an ontology of simulations: simulators agree or at least are incentivized to leave certain parts of their simulations constant, and the extent to which different things are left constant falls out of economic and ecological selection effects.</p>\n<p>The Born rule is a lot less physics-y than the rest of quantum mechanics, akin to how there is a deep sense in which thermodynamics is more about subjective Bayesianism than about universal laws. Thus it's not too bad a sin to instead think of simulators computing different branches of automata. If they sample uniformly from some boring set of possible automata (given some background laws of physics like Conway&rsquo;s game of life) then the end result might look like a Born rule, whereas if they differentially sample based on game theoretic equilibria (formalizable by, like, saying their utility functions are over relative entropies of predictions of automata evolution patterns some of which are more interesting in a Schmidhuberian compressibility sense [assuming they agree on reference Turing machine], for example) then there can be interesting disregularities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(On Google+ I list my occupation as \"Theoretical Thaumaturgist\". ;P )</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

about the role of language in drawing mental maps. For those who don't want to bother watching it, the gist of the video is that the words we use to describe colors may, in fact, alter the way in which we perceive color. In the video, some African tribesmen are shown a circle of colored squares and asked to choose the one different from the others. In the first test, the squares are all green (in fact, almost indistinguishable shades of green), and though westerners have a hard time figuring out the odd one, the Himba get it easily. However, they cannot tell the difference between a bunch of green blocks and a very different shade of blue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/09/10/wiring-the-brain/\">PZ Myers</a> points out that this phenomenon in the video may be caused by different neurological wiring between westerners and this tribe. If that is the case, it seems more likely that their language would evolve to represent our experience of color, rather than vice versa. Either way, I can't help but feel that this sort of thing makes it more difficult to tell when you are talking about maps and when you are talking about the territory.</p>\n<p>Consider the Blue/Green question here (or Blue/Black if we're arguing to the Himba). We're not hidden in a cave, unable to look at the sky. We both look at it, at the same time, and we say it is one color and the Himba say it is another. Who is right? We can try to dissolve this question by saying that, in fact, the sky is neither blue nor black and in fact only appears to us as one or the other because of how our brains model the sensory input from our eyes. But understanding this would not help the Himba see the blue square among the green ones any easier (nor would we westerners be able to see the odd green one among the greens). If this is a question of how our brains are wired, it suggests that we may have other differences in how we perceive the world (though my lack of imagination prevents me from imagining any right now). Can we overcome such things? Is it useful to try? Or would it just lead us to frivolous debates with people who literally cannot see things the same way as we do?<br /><br />If, however, our brains perceive things in certain ways because of the words we use to describe them, this suggests we can better model reality by changing our language. By speaking in terms of biases and utility functions, we tend to do that here on LW. Can this be easily translated offline, into day-to-day interactions? If so, how difficult is it to change thinking patterns (or whole brain structures) by changing language? And how do you know if you are modeling reality more accurately (I can't see that making your beliefs pay rent helps any in the debate between blue and black skies)? How can you get others to understand what you're saying, and have it change their perceptions?<br /><br />Or perhaps I'm just confused.

tries to explain, using cognitive science, why many people find design arguments so compelling. Abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<p>The argument from design stands as one of the most&nbsp;intuitively compelling arguments for the existence of a divine Creator.&nbsp;Yet, for many scientists and philosophers, Hume&rsquo;s critique and&nbsp;Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection have definitely undermined the&nbsp;idea that we can draw any analogy from design in artifacts to design&nbsp;in nature. Here, we examine empirical studies from developmental&nbsp;and experimental psychology to investigate the cognitive basis of the&nbsp;design argument. From this it becomes clear that humans spontaneously&nbsp;discern purpose in nature. When constructed theologically and&nbsp;philosophically correctly, the design argument is not presented as&nbsp;conclusive evidence for God&rsquo;s existence but rather as an abductive,&nbsp;probabilistic argument. We examine the cognitive basis of probabilistic&nbsp;judgments in relationship to natural theology. Placing emphasis&nbsp;on how people assess improbable events, we clarify the intuitive appeal&nbsp;of Paley&rsquo;s watch analogy. We conclude that the reason why some&nbsp;scientists find the design argument compelling and others do not lies&nbsp;not in any intrinsic differences in assessing design in nature but rather&nbsp;in the prior probability they place on complexity being produced by&nbsp;chance events or by a Creator. This difference provides atheists and&nbsp;theists with a rational basis for disagreement</p>\n</p>\n</blockquote>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

others map a few common cognitive biases to the particular decision-making processes in which they are likely to arise. Abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People often create and use shortcuts or &ldquo;rules of thumb&rdquo; to make decisions. The majority of time, reliance on these&nbsp;heuristics helps us to perform efficiently and effectively. &nbsp;Yet, this &nbsp;reliance can also promote bias, or systematic&nbsp;error. &nbsp;Our review of the literature suggests that both decision-making approaches that are rational and natural are&nbsp;likely to be subject to a range of biases. Unfortunately, the available literature provides very little discussion of what&nbsp;aspects biases are likely to impact within each of these processes. &nbsp;In the absence of this discussion, we have&nbsp;attempted to combine our knowledge of the bias literature and the decision-making literature to explore what biases are likely to impact various components of each decision-making process. &nbsp;Includes the following biases: availability, representativeness, anchoring &amp; adjustment, confirmation, hindsight, overconfidence, framing and affect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tables from their

But the particular storyline I'd like to discuss here takes a much more SF turn than usual, and it's (marginally; if we stretch the concepts a bit) related to issues relevant to LessWrong; decision theory, CEV, perhaps even simulations and/or many-worlds.</p>\n<p>The needed context is that in the page immediately previous, one of the comic's two protagonists (Penny) <a href=\"http://www.pennyandaggie.com/index.php?p=566\">is asked by her biker boyfriend Rich</a> to follow him on the road, effectively dropping out of highschool.</p>\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.pennyandaggie.com/index.php?p=567\">chapter itself</a></strong> is about 20 different future Pennies from the year 2020 (20 that represent trillions), convene to decide which choice to take.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6136324936_475629f25d.jpg\" alt=\"pna20071031-secondpanel\" width=\"500\" height=\"359\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Thoughts and SPOILERS for the story to follow after the space, so you may want to read it before proceeding.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<li> The first thing one may notice is that this is a *weird* story that doesn't follow any of the most standard tropes -- it's not truly many worlds or parallel-universe because some realities fade when Penny's eventual decision drops them out of probability space; it's not a \"What-if-I'd taken-a-different-path-in-life\" because it's not meant to discuss a past decision in the life of the character but a current one; it's not time-travel. It's all very conceptual and abstract. </li>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<li> The mode of existence for these alternate future Pennies is left vague and mysterious. They don't have a completely imaginary existence in the mind of Penny, because after the decision is taken some of them persist and discuss it with other people that share said mode. They don't have a completely physical existence, because some of them can <em>fade</em>. And most bizarre of all, most of them voted <em>against their very existence</em>. (7 out of 10 Pennies that followed Rich, voted not to have followed him -- 4 of the Pennies that didn't follow him voted or seemed to want to vote in favor. That makes 11 of 20 Pennies that voted against their existence). <br /><br />Perhaps the best way one can handle this whole bizarreness would be as a visualization of the FAI-failure mode in which <a href=\"/lw/x4/nonperson_predicates/\">the AI's models of people are <em>also</em> people</a>. So that the AI can only anticipate what people would want to do or would regret doing, if he has their simulations actively decide to do it, and then regret it. But for the purposes of the convention, the AI disabled all self-preservation circuitry, so that these models can vote with full honesty the decision they believe best.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li> The twist (sort of) in the story is that the collective will of all these extrapolated future versions vote against joining Rich. But present Penny vetoes their decision and follows Rich anyway -- because she doesn't really care what the probabilities say, she doesn't care what she-herself will think in the future. She's not a person-in-the-making, a person to be extrapolated, she's a person now: <br /> <img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6157/6135924379_0450fab47d.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"167\" /><br /><br />To put it in LessWrong terms: \"Up yours, Extrapolated Volition\".<br /><br />Most intriguingly yet, at least one of those extrapolated versions (Biker Penny who voted against joining Rich and bitterly regretted joining a \"clique for losers\") actually seems to admire and love how Teenage Penny is telling her to go to hell: What if your extrapolated volition is a volition that doesn't wish you to consider the rulings of your extrapolated volition?<br /><br />Also (an even more complicated scenario) what if your current volition wishes you to follow your extrapolated volition, but your extrapolated volition would want you to follow a different decision path (don't consider the future)? What ways are there outside of this paradox? What decision do you take, if you are changed by that decision into a person that will regret it either way for different reasons?\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>There is no truly dystopian universe in the subset of the 10 \"didn't follow Rich\" Pennies -- unlike the future of Holocaust Survivor Penny (and possibly Borg Penny too). It's rather unlikely that going with Rich would cause a global dystopia -- it's much more likely that didnt-follow-Rich Pennies simply didn't survive a dystopia with enough probability density to be represented. Doesn't that make it then a *biased* sample, improper to draw conclusions from? On the other hand, there are a number of unexplored death scenarios in the other subset as well, so if anything both sets are biased...\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>Last note: Though I consider this chapter the pinnacle of the quality in the whole Penny &amp; Aggie comic, both art-wise, writing-wise, idea-wise, and character-wise, I consider the immediately following storyline (a side-story about Korean students we hadn't seen before and haven't seen since) to be the bottom of quality in all of the above (bad guest art, clumsy writing, unremarkable characters, etc). So, if you want to keep reading the comic, I just suggest skipping that whole following chapter.<br /><br />As I said, the rest of the comic is however mostly teenage comedy/drama, though it does include some amusing SF references/tropes from <a href=\"http://www.pennyandaggie.com/index.php?p=416\">time</a> to <a href=\"http://www.pennyandaggie.com/index.php?p=263\">time</a>. </li>",

Upon reflection, my <a href=\"/lw/wj/is_that_your_true_rejection/\">true rejection</a> is my fear of the social cost of cryonics, i.e. being perceived as <a href=\"/lw/wj/is_that_your_true_rejection/\">weird and completely incomprehensible</a> by everyone around me. I've read the <a href=\"http://www.depressedmetabolism.com/is-that-what-love-is-the-hostile-wife-phenomenon-in-cryonics/\">\"Hostile Wife Phenomenon\" article on Depressed Metabolism</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/magazine/11cryonics-t.html\">New York Times Magazine article on Robin Hanson's personal situation</a> (as well as <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/07/modern-male-sati.html\">Robin's reply</a>), and scores of comments on LessWrong, and it looks a lot of cryonicists do indeed experience the feeling that Eliezer describes in <a href=\"/lw/mb/lonely_dissent/\">Lonely Dissent</a>.</p>\n<p>My concerns about the social cost of cryonics can be broken down into two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Loss of existing relationships with family, friends, etc.</em> I value the relationships I currently have with my family and friends, and signing up for cryonics would jeopardize many of these relationships. Most of my friends and family members are not interested in rationality and would be completely baffled if I decided to sign up. Nonetheless, I do not want to lose these relationships, as they are currently an important part of my life; I would consider my life to be significantly worse than it is now if I had to sever a lot of these emotional ties. </li>\n<li><em>Increased difficulty of forming relationships in the future.</em> I'm not particularly good at forming new relationships, and I'm very worried that signing up for cryonics will create an insurmountable social stigma that will make it nearly impossible for me to do so. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, though, I have very little information about what the social cost of cryonics really is beyond a few scattered anecdotes and secondhand descriptions of cryonicists' lives. Ultimately, I don't really know how many of my fears would actually be realized if I signed up. This makes it difficult to for me to make a decision, as I am very risk-averse and I feel reluctant to choose something that could potentially make the next six or seven decades of my life miserable. As a result, I have decided to engage in some data collection.</p>\n<p>To do so, I would like to hear about your experiences. If you are currently signed up for cryonics, I would very much appreciate it if you took a minute or two to describe the effects that signing up has had on your relationships and your social life in general. If you are not signed up, your feedback on this topic is still welcome. Links to articles would be good, but discussion of personal experiences would be better.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null,

I have read some of the LessWrong <a href=\"/lw/546/what_should_i_do/\">resources</a> about this issue, but they don't seem to address my particular concerns. I think there is a high relative importance for selecting a career with a high capacity for making me happy. It will consume at least 8 prime daylight hours of my work days and in many cases also some of the weekend. In all likelihood I will also be forced to <a href=\"http://dailyinfographic.com/sitting-down-is-killing-you-infographic\">sit</a> in front of a computer for extended periods of time. The tasks I am assigned may have nothing to do with the things that I happen to find intellectually interesting or of ethical importance. And the work will likely zap me of most of the energy that I could use to pursue hobbies or other more \"intrinsically worthwhile endeavors\" (intrinsic to my personal preference ordering). Given that I believe these factors will largely determine whether I feel happy in many future situations and also whether I feel generically happy about the content of my life as a whole, I think it is worthwhile to seek advice from other rationalists in how to choose an appropriate career goal and take steps to pursue it.<br /><br />What I have found on LessWrong, however, is that ambiguous and open-ended pleas for advice generally steer off course, even if the tangential issues are very interesting and insightful. Rather than query everyone for open advice about preference hacking, vague goal achievement, and wisdom for properly assigning value to some of the factors I have listed above, I propose a simpler informal job survey.<br /><br />If you are interested, please briefly list the job you have or the job of someone you know very well (well enough that you feel you know relevant details about the job, details that may be hard to gather in less than 1 hour of internet searching). You don't have to reveal the location or name of the employer or anything like that, just the type of job. Optionally, please also include a sentence stating whether you (or your friend, etc.) seem to enjoy the job and why. For example, my entry would be like this:<br /><br />I am a graduate student studying applied mathematics. I enjoy the access to educational resources and the flexible schedule that my current job offers, but I think my personal displeasure with computer programming and my perception that future jobs doing mathematical theory are scarce cause me to dislike the job overall.<br /><br />If enough people are willing to participate, my hope is that the stream of small anecdotal remarks will serve as a brainstorming session. I hope to hear about jobs I may never have thought of, and also reasons for liking or disliking a job that I may never have thought of. The goal is to spark additional search on my own and also to gauge my current preferences in light of preferences that others have experienced with specific jobs. Such a survey would be a very helpful resource allowing me to synthesize data about job directions where the initial search will have a higher probability of being helpful for me. &nbsp;</p>",

effective than trying</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...my system is that I <em>attempt</em> to exercise five times a week around lunchtime. And I always allow myself the option of driving to the gym then turning around and going home. What I've discovered is that the routine of preparing to exercise usually inspires me to go through with it even if I didn't start out in the mood.[...]<br /><br />If I had a goal instead of a system, I would have failed [when I didn't exercise]. And I would have felt like a loser. That can't be good for motivation. That failure might be enough to prevent me from going to the gym the next time I don't feel 100%, just to avoid the risk of another failure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regular Less Wrong readers will remember <span class=\"author\">Eliezer Yudkowsky's warning about <a href=\"/lw/uh/trying_to_try/\">trying to try</a>:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But when we deal with humans, <em>being satisfied with having a plan</em> is not at all like <em>being satisfied with success.</em>&nbsp; The part where the plan has to maximize your probability of succeeding, gets lost along the way.&nbsp; It's far easier to convince ourselves that we are \"maximizing our probability of succeeding\", than it is to convince ourselves that we will succeed.</p>\n<p>Almost any effort will serve to convince us that we have \"tried our hardest\", if trying our hardest is all we are trying to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Adams says the danger of trying is that you will fail in trying, which will bruise your self-esteem and cripple your motivation to try again. Yudkowsky says the danger of trying to try is that you will succeed in trying to try, leaving you too easily satisfied and unmotivated to actually <strong>do</strong> the thing you were trying to try to do.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Have any readers had success in trying to try?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false,

I believed that I was thinking things through seriously, and coming to difficult but true conclusions about what had happened, what would happen, what must happen. Here is part of what I wrote, to friends and family, several days later:\n<blockquote><em> Our President has made it clear: we are at war. I do not anticipate that this will be a short or an easy war. Our enemy has operations in dozens of countries, including this one. He is supported, out of enthusiasm or fear, by many governments among our purported friends as well as among our enemies. He has shown his cunning, his ruthlessness, and most of all his patience, in his successful plot to kill thousands of innocents and bring down the symbols of our civilization. And in striking at him, as we must, we will bring down others who will in turn seek their own vengeance upon us.</em></blockquote>\nThere is not a single factual assertion in that paragraph that I had any reason to believe I could substantiate. I did not know anything about the enemy. I had no idea whether or not there were &ldquo;operations&rdquo; in dozens of countries &ndash; I don&rsquo;t even know what I meant by &ldquo;operations.&rdquo; I know what I was referring to with the business about being &ldquo;supported&rdquo; by friends and enemies, but &ldquo;support&rdquo; is a deliberately fuzzy word; I wouldn&rsquo;t have used it if I was trying to make a concrete assertion with clear implications. The purpose of that assertion, like everything else, was to build up my first assertion. We were at war. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be short or easy. Because that conclusion, though grim, was one that imparted meaning to the murder of 3,000 people. I thought I was being serious &ndash; examining the facts, calculating the likely negative consequences of necessary action, preparing myself for the unfortunate necessities of life. But I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything of the kind. I was engaged in a search for meaning in which reason was purely instrumental.</blockquote>\n<p>Link (which includes additional good retrospectives) thanks to <a href=\"http://www.amptoons.com/blog/2011/09/11/the-911-anniversary/\">Ampersand</a>.</p>\n<p>This article may have more political content than is suitable for LW-- if you'd rather discuss it elsewhere, I've linked it at <a href=\"http://nancylebov.livejournal.com/502459.html\">my blog</a>.

class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[warning: this is another gooey self-disclosure in the spirit of <a href=\"/user/Alicorn/submitted/\">Alicorn</a> and <a href=\"/lw/7dy/a_rationalists_tale/\">lukeprog&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;recent posts, except more so.]</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"></strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">According to my submissions summary, my first top-level post dates back to February 18<sup>th</sup>, 2011. (I don&rsquo;t know exactly when I started commenting, but I don&rsquo;t feel like clicking through dozens of pages of old comments to find out.) By then, it had already been a month since I embarked on the most deliberate and probably the most difficult act of self-modification that I&rsquo;ve ever attempted, and definitely the one I&rsquo;m proudest of. At this point, I think I can say confidently that I&rsquo;ve fixed one of the most irrational facets of my behaviour. A few people here know quite a bit about this, namely <a href=\"/user/Molybdenumblue/\">molybdenumblue</a>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">[Aside: some people might find this article very personal. I&rsquo;ve never had a strong privacy instinct, and since in this case it&rsquo;s all <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">my </em>personal information*, and I talk openly about most of it with my friends and family, I have no qualms about publishing it. If it makes you uncomfortable, please feel free to stop reading.] </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">My New Year&rsquo;s resolution for 2011, which I clearly remember making in my parents&rsquo; kitchen, was to experiment more with relationships. I had been in 2 relationships by my 19<sup>th</sup> birthday: one at age 14 with a much older recent immigrant to Canada who went to my high school, and one at age 17 with a boy who I worshipped when I was 12. Neither of them led anywhere interesting, in either an emotional or a physical sense. After breaking up with my second boyfriend, I was about ready to give up and start calling myself asexual. But since I had very little data to go on, an experiment seemed like a good idea. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I chose my experimental subject carefully: Billy, a boy I met through competitive lifeguarding, who was my age and seemed to share some of my values; he was in good shape, anyway; and whom I found moderately attractive. (I&rsquo;ve been attracted to girls in the past, but that seemed like a more complicated experiment to set up.) I found him interesting without being too intimidating. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I had had some success in the past with getting boys&rsquo; initial attention, and I felt like I knew what I was doing. I started a conversation one evening when I came to swim at the campus pool and he was the lifeguard on duty, and I made an effort to be my friendliest and chattiest self. The next day I added him on Facebook, and suggested via the chat function that maybe we could hang out after guard team practice&hellip;The message must have gone though, because less than a week later, after he made me dinner at his apartment, he walked me home and kissed me outside the shared house where I was living. I went inside, shaking all over and not really sure whether I&rsquo;d enjoyed it, but triumphant: success!</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The only problem was that now that I had my result, I couldn&rsquo;t end the experiment as easily as I&rsquo;d started it. Some making out ensued, at my place and at his place. I found all of it vaguely embarrassing and a bit freaky, too; my only previous experience was with my first boyfriend, and at fourteen it had seriously grossed me out. By the end of the week, we ended up back at his apartment after some alcohol consumption, and clothes came off. I tried really hard to be okay with it. After all, it was part of my experiment, and I&rsquo;d thought it was something I wanted. But irrational fears aren&rsquo;t turned off that easily. When he told me that I drove him crazy, I wasn&rsquo;t flattered: I was completely terrified. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I spent the next week or so putting on my game face and pretending everything was awesome, while crying on the phone with my younger sister every other night. (I can honestly say that although she&rsquo;s five years younger, her social skills are <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">much </em>better than mine.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I thought over and rejected various solutions because, ultimately, I liked Billy okay and I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt his feelings. Open communication hadn&rsquo;t existed in my previous relationships, so I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I was also more and more sleep deprived; my schedule had already been busy before, juggling school with two part-time jobs, and now it was unsustainable. The emotions built up, and I ended up handling it in what was probably the worst possible way: walking home from guard team practice, I started crying when he asked me if I was okay. (Bursting into tears when I don&rsquo;t want to talk about something or do something and someone pushes me is a bad habit I picked up during my days of swim team performance anxiety.) It took at least an hour to get everything out: that I didn&rsquo;t know what my feelings were, that it freaked me out when he touched me, and that if I had to sacrifice another night&rsquo;s sleep to hang out I would probably go insane. And also the part I&rsquo;d been too embarrassed to tell him earlier: I had a condition called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginismus\">vaginismus</a>, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to have sex even if I wanted to and felt ready. He walked me back to my house, carefully not touching, and I went upstairs to bed, feeling like a terrible person but also relieved. At least that was over. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\"></em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I can&rsquo;t really take the credit for this next part; if I hadn&rsquo;t heard from him again, I think I would have walked away from it, not happily exactly, but determined never to get myself into a mess like that again. But I woke up at 6:30 to a text: <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Check your email</em>. He had written me a long, fairly incoherent message, full of grammatical mistakes, but probably the sweetest thing that anyone had ever written to me, ever, in my whole life. Ending with: &ldquo;</span><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language: EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">With all that said, I realize that I am not just about ready to give up on us. [...] For now, I see what we have together is worth fighting for.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">I cried, felt trapped, felt miserable, and finally made myself a cup of tea, sat in my living room, decided that I&rsquo;d gotten myself into this situation in the first place and I would have to cope with it. I phrased my reply carefully. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">&ldquo;I wanted to be everything you wanted me to be, and as soon as I knew for sure that I couldn't be that, I was terrified that you would find out and you wouldn't want me anymore. [...] I'm scared that as soon as I open myself to you, you'll reject me for being such a freak and then I'll lose you AND be hurt. [...] I kinda wish we could just start over, and go more slowly, and I wouldn't get scared and I'd be able to act maturely and not like a 13-year-old in over her head.&rdquo; The problem wasn&rsquo;t that I didn&rsquo;t like him. I liked him as much as I&rsquo;d liked any other boy. <em>That </em>was the scary part.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">A few weeks later we went out for his birthday. I baked a cake and he blew out the candles. Later he told me that he had made a wish; that our relationship would work out. It was a lot of pressure, and I tried to hide the fact that it still freaked me out when he said things like that. But part of me found it romantic, and that was the part I tried hard to focus on.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">I don&rsquo;t remember the timeline as clearly for the next few months. We hung out regularly, swam together and worked out together, and spent an entire guard team competition getting in trouble with the coach (&ldquo;no touching!&rdquo;). I brought him Tupperwares of food when he worked Saturday afternoon shifts at the pool. We did our homework together (him doing economics math problems, me making a colorful cardboard poster for my nursing placement in a daycare, probably the first time in my life I felt like the non-nerd in the room). We both said, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">We fought about a lot of things, too, mainly the fact that he always wanted to see me more and I always wanted more time to read, write, swim, and sleep. But we talked everything through and usually came to some kind of compromise. I started sleeping over at his apartment once or twice a week, which I resented because sharing a single bed meant that I didn&rsquo;t so much sleep as lie awkwardly awake for almost the whole night. We did our grocery shopping together. Gradually we started touching again, and I habituated to it, although some things still freaked me out. I only felt comfortable making out if the lights were on. I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything at my place, because I was afraid my roommates would judge me. (They probably did.) In short, those months weren&rsquo;t exactly the happiest of my life: I was stressed, exhausted, and under pressure all the time. <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">At some point during the spring, I can&rsquo;t remember the month exactly, I had my first orgasm when he was touching me. It was a huge surprise: &ldquo;my body can do that?&rdquo; Molybdenumblue and my mother both recommended that I practice, so I started masturbating for the first time in my life. But sex was still the main thing we fought about. Eventually we worked out a routine where I could at least satisfy his needs without too much time or effort. The semester was nearly over by now, and at some point we had decided that we wanted to try living together in the summer. We had been dating for less than four months. All of my roommates and many of my friends thought it was a terrible idea. My mother approved wholeheartedly, though, and I trusted her judgment. We moved into a subletted apartment on campus at the beginning of May. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">It could have gone badly, but it went incredibly well. We had a double bed and I was actually able to sleep well nearly every night. I was working a lot, usually more than 45 hours a week, and juggling my mandatory exercise routines, but seeing each other at night was the default, rather than another commitment to slot into my schedule. Sex still wasn&rsquo;t happening, so I went to see my family doctor and she recommended a physiotherapy routine that I could practice at home, and we were having sex maybe three weeks later. About the only thing I liked was that it was over quickly, but it still felt like an incredible accomplishment. My mother bought me chocolate as a reward for my hard work. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">It seemed to be the end of the last snag in our relationship, the last obstacle that would have kept us from staying together long-term. We talk about everything, from the possibility of having kids someday (though definitely not soon, even though kids are uber-cute and I have to work with them every day at the pool and <em>I want one too</em>) to my crush on a girl at work. (When I was planning to go for a swim with her at the campus pool: &ldquo;Aww, have fun on your lesbian date!&rdquo;) </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">Conclusion: Billy left for a four-month exchange in France at the end of September, just before I went back to school for another semester of madly juggling school, work, and exercise, hoping that I would be able to cut back on my workaholic-ism; it&rsquo;s irrational to think I&rsquo;ll <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">actually </em>go bankrupt if I only work one shift a week. I was optimistic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">...And that was when I realized that I don&rsquo;t feel like a scared thirteen-year-old girl anymore. I don&rsquo;t feel like a freak and I don&rsquo;t feel inadequate. I don&rsquo;t find the day-to-day of a relationship stressful. I&rsquo;ve made a ton of compromises, smoothed off some of the stubbornly contrarian aspects of my personality, and I don&rsquo;t resent it; I feel <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">good </em>about it. My feelings are no longer as unpredictable as the weather, and when something does upset me, I almost always understand why and know how to fix it. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">I couldn&rsquo;t have achieved this on my own. I&rsquo;ve relied on my mother, my sister, my best friend, and molybdenumblue. Not to mention one of the most incredibly patient, open-minded, and persistent people I&rsquo;ve met in my life: Billy himself. But it&rsquo;s a success story for me, even so. <a href=\"/lw/h8/tsuyoku_naritai_i_want_to_become_stronger/\">I wanted to be stronger</a>, so I tried to change myself, and it was harder than anything I had ever done before, and I could have given up and walked away, but I decided to keep trying. And that's what makes it my greatest achievement.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none\"><br />*Billy has read this and ok'd

Vague advice like \"be skeptical\" and \"think critically\" may not help much. Luckily, cognitive scientists know a great deal about the mathematics of <em>correct</em> thinking, how thinking errors are <em>produced</em>, and how we can <em>overcome</em> these errors in order to live more fulfilling lives.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Rationality</h4>\n<p>First, what is <a href=\"/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/\">rationality</a>? It is not the same thing as intelligence, because even those with high intelligence fall prey to some thinking errors as often as everyone else.<sup>5</sup> But then, what <em>is</em> rationality?</p>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sherlock-holmes1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"353\" height=\"276\" />Cognitive scientists recognize two kinds of rationality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Epistemic rationality</strong> is about forming true beliefs, about getting the <em>map in your head</em> to accurately reflect the <em>territory of the world</em>. We can measure epistemic rationality by comparing the rules of logic and probability theory to the way that a person <em>actually</em> updates their beliefs.</li>\n<li><strong>Instrumental rationality</strong> is about making decisions that are well-aimed at bringing about what you want. Due to habit and bias, many of our decisions don't actually align with our goals. We can measure instrumental rationality with a variety of techniques developed in economics, for example testing whether a person obeys the 'axioms of choice'.<sup>6</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, rationality improves our choices concerning what to believe and what to do.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, human <em>ir</em>rationality is quite common, as shown in popular books like <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\">Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions</a></em>&nbsp;and <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Kluge-Haphazard-Evolution-Human-Mind/dp/B002ECETZY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\">Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Ever since Aristotle spoke of humans as the \"rational animal,\" we've had a picture of ourselves as rational beings that are hampered by shortcomings like anger and fear and confirmation bias.</p>\n<p>Cognitive science says just the opposite. Cognitive science shows us that humans just <em>are</em>&nbsp;a collection of messy little modules like anger and fear and the modules that produce confirmation bias. We have a <em>few</em> modules for processing logic and probability and rational goal-pursuit, but they are slow and energy-expensive and rarely used.</p>\n<p>As we'll see, our brains avoid using these expensive modules whenever possible. Pete Richerson and Robert Boyd explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...all animals are under stringent selection pressure to be as stupid as they can get away with.<sup>7</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or, as philosopher David Hull put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rule that human beings seem to follow is to engage [rational thought] only when all else fails &mdash; and usually not even then.<sup>8</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><a name=\"HumanReasoning\"></a>Human reasoning</h4>\n<p>So how does human reasoning work, and why does it so often produce mistaken judgments and decisions?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/thinking-fast-and-slow1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"400\" /></a>Today, cognitive scientists talk about <a href=\"/lw/531/how_you_make_judgments_the_elephant_and_its_rider/\">two kinds</a> of processes, what Daniel Kahneman (2011) calls \"fast and slow\" processes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type 1 processes</strong> are fast, do not require conscious attention, do not need input from conscious processes, and can operate in parallel.</li>\n<li><strong>Type 2 processes</strong> are slow, require conscious effort, and generally only work one at a time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Type 1 processes provide judgments quickly, but these judgments are often wrong, and can be overridden by corrective Type 2 processes.</p>\n<p>Type 2 processes are computationally expensive, and thus humans are '<a href=\"/lw/2ey/a_taxonomy_of_bias_the_cognitive_miser/\">cognitive misers</a>'. This means that we (1) default to Type 1 processes whenever possible, and (2) when we <em>must</em> use Type 2 processes, we use the least expensive kinds of Type 2 processes, those with a 'focal bias' &mdash; a disposition to reason from the <em>simplest</em> model available instead of considering all the relevant factors. Hence, we are subject to confirmation bias (our cognition is focused on what we already believe) and other biases.</p>\n<p>So, cognitive miserliness can cause three types of thinking errors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We default to Type 1 processes when Type 2 processes are needed.</li>\n<li>We fail to override Type 1 processes with Type 2 processes.</li>\n<li>Even when we override with Type 2 processes, we use Type 2 processes with focal bias.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But the problem gets worse. If someone is going to override Type 1 processes with Type 2 processes, then she also needs the right <em>content</em>&nbsp;available with which to do the overriding. For example, she may need to override a biased intuitive judgment with a correct application of probability theory, or a correct application of deductive logic. Such tools are called '<a href=\"/lw/2fj/a_taxonomy_of_bias_mindware_problems/\">mindware</a>'.<sup>9</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, thinking can also go wrong if there is a 'mindware gap' &mdash; that is, if an agent lacks crucial mindware like probability theory.</p>\n<p>Finally, thinking can go wrong due to 'contaminated mindware'&nbsp;&mdash; mindware that exists but is <em>wrong</em>. For example, an agent may have the naive belief that they know their own minds quite well, which is <a href=\"/lw/5sk/inferring_our_desires/\">false</a>. Such mistaken mindware can lead to mistaken judgments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Types of errors</h4>\n<p>Given this understanding, a taxonomy of thinking errors could begin like this:<sup>10</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/errors-taxonomy-beginning.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" /></p>\n<p>The circles on the left capture the three normal sources of thinking errors. The three rectangles to the right of 'Cognitive Miserliness' capture the three categories of error that can be caused by cognitive miserliness. The <em>rounded</em>&nbsp;rectangles to the right of 'Mindware Gap' and 'Corrupted Mindware' propose some <em>examples</em>&nbsp;of (1) mindware that, if missing, can cause a mindware gap, and (2) common contaminated mindware.</p>\n<p>The process for solving a reasoning task, then, may look something like this:<sup>11</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Type-1-and-Type-2-process-determination.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" /></p>\n<p>First, do I have mindware available to solve the reasoning problem before me with slow, deliberate, Type 2 processes? If not, my brain must use fast but inaccurate Type 1 processes to solve the problem. If I do have mindware available to solve this problem, do I notice the need to engage it? If not, my brain defaults to the cheaper Type 1 processes. If I <em>do</em>&nbsp;notice the need to engage Type 2 processes and have the necessary mindware, is <em>sustained</em>&nbsp;(as opposed to momentary) 'Type 2 override' required to solve the problem? If not, then I use that mindware to solve the problem. If sustained override <em>is</em>&nbsp;required to solve the reasoning problem and I don't have the cognitive capacity (e.g. working memory) needed to complete the override, then my brain will default back to Type 1 processes. Otherwise, I'll use my cognitive capacities to sustain Type 2 override well enough to complete the reasoning task with my Type 2 processes (mindware).</p>\n<p>That may be something like how our brains determine how to solve a reasoning task.</p>\n<p>It's this model that Stanovich and colleagues (2010) use to explain why, among other things, <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Tasks-that-do-and-do-not-correlate-with-cognitive-ability.pdf\">IQ is correlated with performance on some reasoning tasks but not others</a>. For example, IQ correlates with performance on tests of outcome bias and hindsight bias, but not with performance on tests of anchoring effects and omission bias. To overcome these latter biases, subjects seem to need not just high cognitive capacity (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence\">fluid intelligence</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory\">working memory</a>, etc.), but also specific rationality training.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/reflective-algorithmic-autonomous.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" />If this is right, then we may talk of three different 'minds' at work in solving reasoning problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>autonomous</em>&nbsp;mind, made of unconscious Type 1 processes. There are few individual differences in its operation.</li>\n<li>The <em>algorithmic</em>&nbsp;mind, made of conscious Type 2 processes. There are significant individual differences in fluid intelligence in particular and cognitive capacity in general &mdash; that is, differences in&nbsp;perceptual speed, discrimination accuracy, working memory capacity,&nbsp;and the efficiency of the retrieval of information stored in long-term memory.<sup>12</sup></li>\n<li>The <em>reflective mind</em>, which shows individual differences in the disposition to use rationality mindware &mdash; the disposition to generate alternative hypotheses, to use fully disjunctive reasoning, to engage in actively open-minded thinking, etc.<sup>13</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a name=\"RationalitySkills\"></a></p>\n<h4>Rationality Skills</h4>\n<p>But it is not enough to understand how the human brain produces thinking errors. We also must find ways to meliorate the problem if we want to have more accurate beliefs and more efficiently achieve our goals. As Milkman et al. (2010) say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...the time has come to move the study of biases in judgment and&nbsp;decision making beyond description and toward the development of improvement&nbsp;strategies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stanovich (2009) sums up our project:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To jointly achieve epistemic and instrumental rationality, a person must display judicious decision making, adequate behavioral regulation, wise goal prioritization, sufficient thoughtfulness, and proper evidence calibration. For example, epistemic rationality &mdash; beliefs that are properly matched to the world &mdash; requires&nbsp;probabilistic reasoning and the ability to calibrate theories to evidence. Instrumental rationality &mdash; maximizing goal fulfillment &mdash; requires adherence to all of the axioms of rational choice. People fail to fulfill the many different strictures of rational thought because they are cognitive misers, because they lack critical mindware, and because they have acquired contaminated mindware. These errors can be prevented by acquiring the mindware of rational thought and the thinking dispositions that prevent the overuse of the strategies of the cognitive miser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the project of 'debiasing' ourselves<sup>14</sup> with 'ameliorative psychology'.<sup>15</sup></p>\n<p>What we want is a <strong>Rationality Toolkit</strong>: a set of skills and techniques that can be used to overcome and correct the errors of our primate brains so we can form more accurate beliefs and make better decisions.</p>\n<p>Our goal is not unlike Carl Sagan's '<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUB4j0n2UDU\">Baloney Detection Kit</a>', but the tools in our Rationality Toolkit will be more specific and better grounded in the cognitive science of rationality.</p>\n<p>I mentioned some examples of debiasing interventions that have been tested by experimental psychologists in my post <a href=\"/lw/76x/is_rationality_teachable/\">Is Rationality Teachable?</a>&nbsp;I'll start with those, then add a few techniques for ameliorating the <a href=\"/lw/jg/planning_fallacy/\">planning fallacy</a>, and we've got the beginnings of our Rationality Toolkit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A simple instruction to \"think about alternatives\" can promote resistance to overconfidence and confirmation bias. In one study, subjects asked to generate their own hypotheses are more responsive to their accuracy than subjects asked to choose from among pre-picked hypotheses.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Another study required subjects to list reasons for and against each of the possible answers to each question on a quiz prior to choosing an answer and assessing the probability of its being correct. This process resulted in more accurate confidence judgments relative to a control group.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Training in microeconomics can help subjects avoid the sunk cost fallacy.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Because people avoid the base rate fallacy more often when they encounter problems phrased in terms of frequencies instead of probabilities,<sup>19</sup> teaching people to translate probabilistic reasoning tasks into frequency formats improves their performance.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Warning people about biases can decrease their prevalence. So far, this has been demonstrated to work with regard to framing effects,<sup>21</sup> hindsight bias,<sup>22</sup> and the outcome effect,<sup>23</sup> though attempts to mitigate anchoring effects by warning people about them have produced weak results so far.<sup>24</sup></li>\n<li>Research on the planning fallacy suggests that taking an 'outside view' when predicting the time and resources required to complete a task will lead to better predictions. A specific instance of this strategy is 'reference class forecasting',<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;in which planners project time and resource costs for a project by basing their projections on the outcomes of a distribution of comparable projects.</li>\n<li>Unpacking the components involved in a large task or project helps people to see more clearly how much time and how many resources will be required to complete it, thereby partially meliorating the planning fallacy.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>One reason we fall prey to the planning fallacy is that we do not remain as focused on the task at hand throughout its execution as when we are planning its execution. The planning fallacy can be partially meliorated, then, not only by improving the planning but by improving the execution. For example, in one study<sup>27</sup> students were taught to imagine themselves performing each of the steps needed to complete a project. Participants rehearsed these simulations each day. 41% of these students completed their tasks on time, compared to 14% in a control group.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But this is <a href=\"/lw/5x8/teachable_rationality_skills/\">only the start</a>. We need more rationality skills, and we need step-by-step instructions for how to teach them and how to implement them at the <a href=\"/lw/5kz/the_5second_level/\">5-second level</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Notes</h4>\n<p><small><sup>1</sup> Teger (1980).</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;A sunk cost is a cost from the past that cannot be recovered. Because decision makers should consider only the future costs and benefits of the choices before them, sunk costs should be irrelevant to human decisions. Alas, sunk costs regularly do effect human decisions: Knox &amp; Inkster (1968); Arkes &amp; Blumer (1985); Arkes &amp; Ayton (1999); Arkes &amp; Hutzel (2000); Staw (1976); Whyte (1986).</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;People are more generous (say, in giving charity) toward a single identifiable victim than toward unidentifiable or statistical victims (Kogut &amp; Ritov 2005a, 2010; Jenni &amp; Loewenstein 1997; Small &amp; Loewenstein 2003; Small et al. 2007; Slovic 2007), even though they say they prefer to give to a group of people (Kogut &amp; Ritov 2005b).</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Yudkowsky summarizes <a href=\"/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/\">scope insensitivity</a>:</small></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><small>Once upon a time, three groups of subjects were asked how much they would pay to save 2000 / 20000 / 200000 migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered $80, $78, and $88 [Desvousges et al. 1992]. This is scope insensitivity or scope neglect: the number of birds saved &mdash; the scope of the altruistic action &mdash; had little effect on willingness to pay.</small></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>See also: Kahneman (1986); McFadden &amp; Leonard (1995); Carson &amp; Mitchell (1995); Fetherstonhaugh et al.

(2008) write:</small></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><small>Cognitive scientists recognize two types of rationality: instrumental and epistemic... [We] could characterize instrumental rationality as the optimization of the individual&rsquo;s goal fulfillment. Economists and cognitive scientists have re\ufb01ned the notion of optimization of goal fulfillment into the technical notion of expected utility. The model of rational judgment used by decision scientists is one in which a person chooses options based on which option has the largest expected utility...</small></p>\n<p><small>The other aspect of rationality studied by cognitive scientists is termed epistemic rationality. This aspect of rationality concerns how well beliefs map onto the actual structure of the world. Instrumental and epistemic rationality are related. The aspect of beliefs that enter into instrumental calculations (i.e., tacit calculations) are the probabilities of states of affairs in the world.</small></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>Also see the discussion in Stanovich et al. (2011). On instrumental rationality as the maximization of expected utility, see&nbsp;Dawes (1998); Hastie &amp; Dawes (2009);&nbsp;Wu et al. (2004). On epistemic reality, see Foley (1987); Harman (1995); Manktelow (2004); Over (2004).</small></p>\n<p><small>How can we measure an individual's divergence from expected utility maximization if we can't yet measure utility directly? One of the triumphs of decision science is the demonstration that agents whose behavior respects the so-called 'axioms of choice' will behave as if they are maximizing expected utility. It can be difficult to measure utility, but it is easier to measure whether one of the axioms of choice are being violated, and thus whether an agent is behaving instrumentally irrationally.</small></p>\n<p><small>Violations of both instrumental and epistemic rationality have been catalogued at length by cognitive psychologists in the 'heuristics and biases' literature: Baron (2007); Evans (1989, 2007); Gilovich et al.

Vague advice like \"be skeptical\" and \"think critically\" may not help much.

It is not the same thing as intelligence, because even those with high intelligence fall prey to some thinking errors as often as everyone else.<sup>5</sup> But then, what <em>is</em> rationality?</p>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sherlock-holmes1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"353\" height=\"276\">Cognitive scientists recognize two kinds of rationality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Epistemic rationality</strong> is about forming true beliefs, about getting the <em>map in your head</em> to accurately reflect the <em>territory of the world</em>. We can measure epistemic rationality by comparing the rules of logic and probability theory to the way that a person <em>actually</em> updates their beliefs.</li>\n<li><strong>Instrumental rationality</strong> is about making decisions that are well-aimed at bringing about what you want. Due to habit and bias, many of our decisions don't actually align with our goals. We can measure instrumental rationality with a variety of techniques developed in economics, for example testing whether a person obeys the 'axioms of choice'.<sup>6</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, rationality improves our choices concerning what to believe and what to do.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, human <em>ir</em>rationality is quite common, as shown in popular books like <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\">Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions</a></em>&nbsp;and <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Kluge-Haphazard-Evolution-Human-Mind/dp/B002ECETZY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\">Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Ever since Aristotle spoke of humans as the \"rational animal,\" we've had a picture of ourselves as rational beings that are hampered by shortcomings like anger and fear and confirmation bias.</p>\n<p>Cognitive science says just the opposite. Cognitive science shows us that humans just <em>are</em>&nbsp;a collection of messy little modules like anger and fear and the modules that produce confirmation bias. We have a <em>few</em> modules for processing logic and probability and rational goal-pursuit, but they are slow and energy-expensive and rarely used.</p>\n<p>As we'll see, our brains avoid using these expensive modules whenever possible. Pete Richerson and Robert Boyd explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...all animals are under stringent selection pressure to be as stupid as they can get away with.<sup>7</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or, as philosopher David Hull put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rule that human beings seem to follow is to engage [rational thought] only when all else fails \u2014 and usually not even then.<sup>8</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Human_reasoning\"><a name=\"HumanReasoning\"></a>Human reasoning</h4>\n<p>So how does human reasoning work, and why does it so often produce mistaken judgments and decisions?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/thinking-fast-and-slow1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"400\"></a>Today, cognitive scientists talk about <a href=\"/lw/531/how_you_make_judgments_the_elephant_and_its_rider/\">two kinds</a> of processes, what Daniel Kahneman (2011) calls \"fast and slow\" processes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type 1 processes</strong> are fast, do not require conscious attention, do not need input from conscious processes, and can operate in parallel.</li>\n<li><strong>Type 2 processes</strong> are slow, require conscious effort, and generally only work one at a time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Type 1 processes provide judgments quickly, but these judgments are often wrong, and can be overridden by corrective Type 2 processes.</p>\n<p>Type 2 processes are computationally expensive, and thus humans are '<a href=\"/lw/2ey/a_taxonomy_of_bias_the_cognitive_miser/\">cognitive misers</a>'. This means that we (1) default to Type 1 processes whenever possible, and (2) when we <em>must</em> use Type 2 processes, we use the least expensive kinds of Type 2 processes, those with a 'focal bias' \u2014 a disposition to reason from the <em>simplest</em> model available instead of considering all the relevant factors. Hence, we are subject to confirmation bias (our cognition is focused on what we already believe) and other biases.</p>\n<p>So, cognitive miserliness can cause three types of thinking errors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We default to Type 1 processes when Type 2 processes are needed.</li>\n<li>We fail to override Type 1 processes with Type 2 processes.</li>\n<li>Even when we override with Type 2 processes, we use Type 2 processes with focal bias.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But the problem gets worse. If someone is going to override Type 1 processes with Type 2 processes, then she also needs the right <em>content</em>&nbsp;available with which to do the overriding. For example, she may need to override a biased intuitive judgment with a correct application of probability theory, or a correct application of deductive logic. Such tools are called '<a href=\"/lw/2fj/a_taxonomy_of_bias_mindware_problems/\">mindware</a>'.<sup>9</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, thinking can also go wrong if there is a 'mindware gap' \u2014 that is, if an agent lacks crucial mindware like probability theory.</p>\n<p>Finally, thinking can go wrong due to 'contaminated mindware'&nbsp;\u2014 mindware that exists but is <em>wrong</em>. For example, an agent may have the naive belief that they know their own minds quite well, which is <a href=\"/lw/5sk/inferring_our_desires/\">false</a>. Such mistaken mindware can lead to mistaken judgments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Types_of_errors\">Types of errors</h4>\n<p>Given this understanding, a taxonomy of thinking errors could begin like this:<sup>10</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/errors-taxonomy-beginning.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>The circles on the left capture the three normal sources of thinking errors. The three rectangles to the right of 'Cognitive Miserliness' capture the three categories of error that can be caused by cognitive miserliness. The <em>rounded</em>&nbsp;rectangles to the right of 'Mindware Gap' and 'Corrupted Mindware' propose some <em>examples</em>&nbsp;of (1) mindware that, if missing, can cause a mindware gap, and (2) common contaminated mindware.</p>\n<p>The process for solving a reasoning task, then, may look something like this:<sup>11</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Type-1-and-Type-2-process-determination.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>First, do I have mindware available to solve the reasoning problem before me with slow, deliberate, Type 2 processes? If not, my brain must use fast but inaccurate Type 1 processes to solve the problem. If I do have mindware available to solve this problem, do I notice the need to engage it? If not, my brain defaults to the cheaper Type 1 processes. If I <em>do</em>&nbsp;notice the need to engage Type 2 processes and have the necessary mindware, is <em>sustained</em>&nbsp;(as opposed to momentary) 'Type 2 override' required to solve the problem? If not, then I use that mindware to solve the problem. If sustained override <em>is</em>&nbsp;required to solve the reasoning problem and I don't have the cognitive capacity (e.g. working memory) needed to complete the override, then my brain will default back to Type 1 processes. Otherwise, I'll use my cognitive capacities to sustain Type 2 override well enough to complete the reasoning task with my Type 2 processes (mindware).</p>\n<p>That may be something like how our brains determine how to solve a reasoning task.</p>\n<p>It's this model that Stanovich and colleagues (2010) use to explain why, among other things, <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Tasks-that-do-and-do-not-correlate-with-cognitive-ability.pdf\">IQ is correlated with performance on some reasoning tasks but not others</a>. For example, IQ correlates with performance on tests of outcome bias and hindsight bias, but not with performance on tests of anchoring effects and omission bias. To overcome these latter biases, subjects seem to need not just high cognitive capacity (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence\">fluid intelligence</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory\">working memory</a>, etc.), but also specific rationality training.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/reflective-algorithmic-autonomous.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\">If this is right, then we may talk of three different 'minds' at work in solving reasoning problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>autonomous</em>&nbsp;mind, made of unconscious Type 1 processes. There are few individual differences in its operation.</li>\n<li>The <em>algorithmic</em>&nbsp;mind, made of conscious Type 2 processes. There are significant individual differences in fluid intelligence in particular and cognitive capacity in general \u2014 that is, differences in&nbsp;perceptual speed, discrimination accuracy, working memory capacity,&nbsp;and the efficiency of the retrieval of information stored in long-term memory.<sup>12</sup></li>\n<li>The <em>reflective mind</em>, which shows individual differences in the disposition to use rationality mindware \u2014 the disposition to generate alternative hypotheses, to use fully disjunctive reasoning, to engage in actively open-minded thinking, etc.<sup>13</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a name=\"RationalitySkills\"></a></p>\n<h4 id=\"Rationality_Skills\">Rationality Skills</h4>\n<p>But it is not enough to understand how the human brain produces thinking errors. We also must find ways to meliorate the problem if we want to have more accurate beliefs and more efficiently achieve our goals. As Milkman et al. (2010) say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...the time has come to move the study of biases in judgment and&nbsp;decision making beyond description and toward the development of improvement&nbsp;strategies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stanovich (2009) sums up our project:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To jointly achieve epistemic and instrumental rationality, a person must display judicious decision making, adequate behavioral regulation, wise goal prioritization, sufficient thoughtfulness, and proper evidence calibration. For example, epistemic rationality \u2014 beliefs that are properly matched to the world \u2014 requires&nbsp;probabilistic reasoning and the ability to calibrate theories to evidence. Instrumental rationality \u2014 maximizing goal fulfillment \u2014 requires adherence to all of the axioms of rational choice. People fail to fulfill the many different strictures of rational thought because they are cognitive misers, because they lack critical mindware, and because they have acquired contaminated mindware. These errors can be prevented by acquiring the mindware of rational thought and the thinking dispositions that prevent the overuse of the strategies of the cognitive miser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the project of 'debiasing' ourselves<sup>14</sup> with 'ameliorative psychology'.<sup>15</sup></p>\n<p>What we want is a <strong>Rationality Toolkit</strong>: a set of skills and techniques that can be used to overcome and correct the errors of our primate brains so we can form more accurate beliefs and make better decisions.</p>\n<p>Our goal is not unlike Carl Sagan's '<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUB4j0n2UDU\">Baloney Detection Kit</a>', but the tools in our Rationality Toolkit will be more specific and better grounded in the cognitive science of rationality.</p>\n<p>I mentioned some examples of debiasing interventions that have been tested by experimental psychologists in my post <a href=\"/lw/76x/is_rationality_teachable/\">Is Rationality Teachable?</a>&nbsp;I'll start with those, then add a few techniques for ameliorating the <a href=\"/lw/jg/planning_fallacy/\">planning fallacy</a>, and we've got the beginnings of our Rationality Toolkit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A simple instruction to \"think about alternatives\" can promote resistance to overconfidence and confirmation bias. In one study, subjects asked to generate their own hypotheses are more responsive to their accuracy than subjects asked to choose from among pre-picked hypotheses.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Another study required subjects to list reasons for and against each of the possible answers to each question on a quiz prior to choosing an answer and assessing the probability of its being correct. This process resulted in more accurate confidence judgments relative to a control group.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Training in microeconomics can help subjects avoid the sunk cost fallacy.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Because people avoid the base rate fallacy more often when they encounter problems phrased in terms of frequencies instead of probabilities,<sup>19</sup> teaching people to translate probabilistic reasoning tasks into frequency formats improves their performance.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Warning people about biases can decrease their prevalence. So far, this has been demonstrated to work with regard to framing effects,<sup>21</sup> hindsight bias,<sup>22</sup> and the outcome effect,<sup>23</sup> though attempts to mitigate anchoring effects by warning people about them have produced weak results so far.<sup>24</sup></li>\n<li>Research on the planning fallacy suggests that taking an 'outside view' when predicting the time and resources required to complete a task will lead to better predictions. A specific instance of this strategy is 'reference class forecasting',<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;in which planners project time and resource costs for a project by basing their projections on the outcomes of a distribution of comparable projects.</li>\n<li>Unpacking the components involved in a large task or project helps people to see more clearly how much time and how many resources will be required to complete it, thereby partially meliorating the planning fallacy.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>One reason we fall prey to the planning fallacy is that we do not remain as focused on the task at hand throughout its execution as when we are planning its execution. The planning fallacy can be partially meliorated, then, not only by improving the planning but by improving the execution. For example, in one study<sup>27</sup> students were taught to imagine themselves performing each of the steps needed to complete a project. Participants rehearsed these simulations each day. 41% of these students completed their tasks on time, compared to 14% in a control group.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But this is <a href=\"/lw/5x8/teachable_rationality_skills/\">only the start</a>. We need more rationality skills, and we need step-by-step instructions for how to teach them and how to implement them at the <a href=\"/lw/5kz/the_5second_level/\">5-second level</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Notes\">Notes</h4>\n<p><small><sup>1</sup> Teger (1980).</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;A sunk cost is a cost from the past that cannot be recovered.

The model of rational judgment used by decision scientists is one in which a person chooses options based on which option has the largest expected utility...</small></p>\n<p><small>The other aspect of rationality studied by cognitive scientists is termed epistemic rationality. This aspect of rationality concerns how well beliefs map onto the actual structure of the world. Instrumental and epistemic rationality are related.

One of the triumphs of decision science is the demonstration that agents whose behavior respects the so-called 'axioms of choice' will behave as if they are maximizing expected utility.

All of the following is written with the tournament rules in mind, with scores depicted as deviations of matches with full mutual cooperation since the actual number of turns per match is arbitrary anyway. Also, the hypothetical objective is not to have the highest population after a certain number of generations, but to achieve lasting superiority eventually while treating near-clones that behave exactly the same in the late game as one single strategy. The results of tournaments with a very limited number of generations depend way too much on the pool of submitted strategies to be of general interest, in my opinion.</p>\n<p>This post starts out with practical observations and some universal rules and gets increasingly theoretical. Here is a short glossary of terms I presume known:</p>\n<p><em>Feeding</em> on a strategy: Scoring higher against that strategy in a match than against itself.<br /><em>Outperforming</em> a strategy: Outscoring that strategy over the course of matches against all other strategies in the pool according to populations, including each other and themselves (i.e. improving the population ratio).<br /><em>Dominance</em>: More than 50% of the total population.<br /><em>Dormant</em> strategy: A strategy that will achieve dominance at some point but hasn't done so yet.<br /><em>Extinction</em>: Asymptotical approach to 0% percent of the total population, or actual extinction in case of integer truncation.<br /><em>TFT-nD</em>: A TFT strategy that defects from the nth last turn on, so TFT-0D is vanilla TFT.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: There is only very basic mathematics and logical reasoning in this post, so if anything seems confusing, it must be me using the wrong words (I'm not a native speaker). Please point out any of these cases so that I can correct them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Survival And Dominance</strong></p>\n<p>Let us assume a scenario with only two strategies, one of them dominating which we call X, the other one A.</p>\n<p>Survival Rule:<br /><em>For A in this scenario not to go extinct regardless of initial population, it must score at least equally high against X as X does against itself, and if it doesn't score higher, it must score at least equally high against itself as X does against itself while not losing direct encounters.</em></p>\n<p>Let us assume X is TFT-0D and A is TFT-1D, in which case the numbers are as follows:</p>\n<p>TFT-0D vs TFT-0D = &nbsp; 0 : &nbsp;0<br />TFT-1D vs TFT-0D = +3 : -4</p>\n<p>The survival ratio is +3 : 0. Therefore, in any situation with only TFT and TFT-1D, the latter cannot go extinct. This still doesn't tell us anything about what's needed for achieving dominance, so let's get on with that.</p>\n<p>Dominance rule:<br /><em>For any strategy to achieve dominance in a two-strategy situation where its survival is guaranteed according to the survival rule or where both strategies initially make up for half of the total population, it needs to outscore the other strategy over the course of these four matches:<br />X vs X<br />A vs X (2x)<br />A vs A</em></p>\n<p>Let us again do the numbers with TFT-0D and TFT-1D:</p>\n<p>TFT-0D vs TFT-0D = &nbsp; 0 : 0<br />TFT-1D vs TFT-0D = +3 : -4<br />TFT-1D vs TFT-0D = +3 : -4<br />TFT-1D vs TFT-1D = &nbsp;-3 : -3</p>\n<p>On aggregate, the dominance ratio is 0 : -8. Therefore, TFT-1D will achieve dominance.</p>\n<p>The conditions for A to exterminate the formerly dominant strategy X follow directly from the conditions for avoiding extinction, and since being the only surviving strategy is not the objective anyway they aren't interesting at this point.</p>\n<p>Threshold rule:<br /><em>If A fulfills the conditions for dominance but not the conditions for survival (i.e. it scores less against X than X does against itself), it will need a certain threshold to avoid extinction and achieve dominance.</em></p>\n<p>Thresholds vary from strategy to strategy, but are obviously always below 50%. The more balanced the survival ratio is, the higher the threshold. In most cases though, the threshold is much too low to be of any relevance in a selective tournament.</p>\n<p>You can easily see that any TFT-nD will be dominated by n+1. However, with increasing n the strategy will score lower&nbsp;not only&nbsp;against itself, but also against any TFT-mD with m &lt;= n-2, which makes TFT-nD with large n very unsuccessful in the early generations of the tournament.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A Word About Afterparty</strong></p>\n<p>The logical solution to this problem are \"Afterparty\" strategies that are essentially TFT-nD CliqueBots that return to cooperating if their opponent defected first on the same turn as them. I refer to these strategies as Efficient CliqueBots for reasons that will become apparent later on.</p>\n<p>The \"Afterparty\" strategy suggested on Less Wrong first defects on the sixth last turn, I will therefore call it TFT-D5C from here on. In a TFT-nD dominated tournament, however, TFT-D5C is not the optimum, as you can check by doing the math above. The optimum is in fact TFT-D3C, because it is the TFT-DnC with the lowest n that can exterminate any TFT-DmC with m &gt; n (if the other strategy falls below a certain threshold) as well as dominate any TFT-mD with m &gt;= n - 2 (if it reaches a certain threshold). This means that in a tournament similar to the control group tournament over 1000 generations, it would eventually achieve domination since it is safe from extinction due to scoring equally high respectively higher against TFT-2D and TFT-3D than those score against themselves while winning direct encounters and scoring higher against itself anyway (survival rule):</p>\n<p>TFT-DnC vs TFT-DnC = -3 : -3</p>\n<p>TFT-2D vs TFT-2D = -6 : -6<br />TFT-D3C vs TFT-2D = -6 : -13</p>\n<p>TFT-3Dvs TFT-3D = -9 : -9<br />TFT-D3C vs TFT-3D = -6 : -13</p>\n<p>Also, it outscores TFT-4D (-32 : -38) and TFT-5D (-38 : -48):</p>\n<p>TFT-4D vs TFT-4D = -12 : -12<br />TFT-D3C vs TFT-4D = -13 : -6<br />TFT-D3C vs TFT-4D = -13 : -6<br />TFT-D3C vs TFT-D3C = -3 : -3</p>\n<p>TFT-5D vs TFT-5D = -15 : -15<br />TFT-D3C vs TFT-5D = -16 : -9<br />TFT-D3C vs TFT-5D = -16 : -9<br />TFT-D3C vs TFT-D3C = -3 : -3</p>\n<p>This means that in a situation where TFT-D3C is initially equally well represented as TFT-4D or TFT-5D, it will eventually outperform those (not taking into account TFT-5D feeding on TFT-4D if both are present).</p>\n<p>In any situation with only two strategies both being TFT-DnC variants, TFT-D3C will exterminate any other TFT-DnC strategies once that strategy falls below a certain threshold, because no other TFT-DnC strategy can score higher against TFT-D3C or itself than TFT-D3C does against itself. This is trivially true for all TFT-DnC strategies starting from n = 2:</p>\n<p>TFT-D2C vs TFT-D2C = -3 : -3<br />TFT-D3C vs TFT-D2C = -6 : -13</p>\n<p>The threshold decreases for increasing n.</p>\n<p>TFT-D3C is also certain to gain a better start than any other TFT-DnC strategies with n &gt; 3 due to higher gain from TFT-nD strategies with n &lt;= 3 that dominate the early game. TFT-D1C is essentially the same as TFT-1D and equally outperformed by TFT-2D, while TFT-D2C cannot prevent TFT-D3C from crossing its threshold as TFT-D3C can feed on TFT-2D as well as on TFT-3D / TFT-D2C. This pretty much leaves TFT-D3C as the only viable TFT-DnC strategy to survive in a selective tournament of this kind. However this doesn't take into account true parasites which I will talk more about later.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>CliqueBots</strong></p>\n<p>CliqueBots have faired very poorly in this tournament, however that is mostly because they have been very poorly designed. A CliqueBot that needs five defections to identify a clone is doomed from the start, and any strategy that turns into DefectBot after identifying an alien strategy before the last turns is very doomed anyway. It seems that even though participants anticipated TFT-1D and even TFT-2D, no one considered cooperative CliqueBots a possible solution, which is surprising. So let me introduce a CliqueBot that could technically be considered another optimum of TFT-DnC, although it behaves slightly different (it is not an Efficient CliqueBot). The main idea is to defect on the very first turn and cooperate if the opponent's previous move matches its own previous move, i.e. if facing a clone, and playing TFT-2D or TFT-3D otherwise. Also in case the game begins with defect-coop followed by coop-defect, the CliqueBot will cooperate for a second time, since the opponent can be considered a TFT variant and a high number of mutual cooperations is benefitial. To keep the name short and follow the established naming system, I will from here on refer to CliqueBot strategies that defect once on turn i and otherwise behave pretty much as TFT-nD strategies as i/TFT-nD.</p>\n<p>Some comparison with selected strategies as described in the rules for dominance (four matches each):</p>\n<p>1/TFT-3D vs TFT-0D = -14 : -22<br />1/TFT-3D vs TFT-1D = -14 : -28<br />1/TFT-3D vs TFT-2D = -14 : -34<br />1/TFT-3D vs TFT-3D = -26 : -38<br />1/TFT-3D vs TFT-4D = -34 : -38<br />1/TFT-3D vs TFT-5D = -40 : -50</p>\n<p>However, the survival of any 1/TFT-nD is guaranteed only against TFT-mD with m = n-1. In addition, any TFT-DmC with m &gt;= n-1 will outperform 1/TFT-nD, so 1/TFT-nD (or any other i/TFT-nD for that matter) cannot prevail.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Parasites, Identification And Efficient CliqueBots</strong></p>\n<p>A true parasite is any strategy that pretends to be a clone of its host until the last possible opportunity of gainful defection. TFT is essentially a CliqueBot that identifies its clones by sustained cooperation, and TFT-1D is a parasite of TFT as TFT-2D is of TFT-1D and so on.</p>\n<p>Parasite rule:<br /><em>Since parasites trade points gained from encounters with clones for points gained from encounters with hosts, parasites can never go extinct in a scenario with only them and their hosts, no matter how little their population. Any parasite will also ultimatively achieve dominance in these scenarios, because the points gained from one-sided defection (+7) are more than the points lost from mutual defection (-3).</em></p>\n<p>Of which follows the dormancy rule:<br /><em>A strategy can only win an open-ended selective IPD tournament if it stays dormant until its own parasite has gone extinct.</em></p>\n<p>This means that theoretically any parasite only needs to survive long enough until it is the only strategy left besides its host to achieve ultimate victory, as was the case with TFT-3D, parasite of TFT-2D in the thousand generations tournament. This can easily be achieved if the host is the dominant strategy, because the parasite is better equipped to feed on the host than any other strategy in the pool, which is a guarantee of survival. However, the situation becomes very difficult for a parasite of a parasite of a dominant host in the early game, which is why TFT-4D is probably the highest TFT-nD able to survive and therefore to achieve dominance in this kind of tournament with integer rounding.</p>\n<p>This brings us back to Efficient CliqueBots. All CliqueBots, including vanilla TFT, use identification patterns to identify clones in order to maximise total point gain. Parasites make use of these patterns in order to pretend to be their hosts and maximise their own point gain. Nice CliqueBots like vanilla TFT identify their clones by continuous cooperation, which makes them unable to identify other nice CliqueBots as non-clones. This is why TFT can't ever defect on the last turn when facing CooperateBot and why nice CliqueBots aren't usually considered \"real\" CliqueBots. Non-nice CliqueBots detect clones by mutual defections at fixed identification turns, and cooperate from there on if facing a clone in order to maximise total point gain and avoid the danger of losing points in the late game. So what's better than a parasite of a dominant host? Well obviously a parasite of a dominant host that's also a CliqueBot - because that's what TFT-DnC strategies are, Efficient CliqueBots.</p>\n<p>The decisive feature of Efficient CliqueBots is that their identification turn is late enough so that in case of an alien opponent, they can simply continue defecting until the end, maximizing their efficiency and allowing them to perform better against TFT-nD strategies with higher n. Now the funny thing is that for example TFT-3D is a parasite of not only TFT-2D, but also TFT-D2C, which is what makes TFT-D3C the optimal TFT-DnC because it still outperforms TFT-4D. But is TFT-4D really the optimal parasite of TFT-D3C? Obviously not, because that would be TFT-D2CD - an Efficient CliqueBot parasite of an Efficient CliqueBot parasite (TFT-D3C) of a parasite (TFT-3D) of a parasite (TFT-2D) of a parasite (TFT-1D) of a nice CliqueBot (TFT-0D). According to the parasite rule, in a scenario with only TFT-D3C and TFT-D2CD, the latter will ultimately achieve dominance. Of course it has its own parasite in TFT-DC2D, which in turn has its own parasite TFT-2D2C, which is the host of TFT-2DCD, host of TFT-4D. And TFT-D4C and so on until DefectBot. Obviously DefectBot isn't the solution, it's only a solution to one specific strategy. So what is the solution? Well that mostly depends on the pool of submitted strategies, but the Efficient CliqueBot TFT-D3C still seems a pretty good guess.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Composite Strategies: Parasite-Host Tandems</strong></p>\n<p>So how can we make sure our parasite strategy stays dormant long enough? Well there's one less-than obvious choice, which is to turn it into a Composite strategy. A Composite is pretty much what the name says: At the beginning of each match, with some probability execute strategy A, else execute strategy B. For example, a parasite could with 99% probability execute its host's strategy (e.g. TFT-0D), and with 1% execute the actual parasite strategy (TFT-1D). This would in most cases result in the death of the parasite's parasite (TFT-2D) while still resulting in absolute dominance, albeit very slowly. However this would obviously allow a singleton TFT-1D to feed on the Composite as well as on singleton TFT-0D, achieving dominance very quickly, while at the same time feeding TFT-2D. So 1% doesn't seem to be the ideal percentage, and TFT-2D would have been able to feed on TFT-0D anyway, so TFT-1D is a lost cause from the beginning. Also, even if there never was a singleton TFT-1D and TFT-2D, a similar tandem strategy could simply increase the percentage a bit.</p>\n<p>So let's stop talking about Parasite-Host Tandems and instead focus on other kinds of Composites that seem more promising.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Composite Strategies: Independent Tandems</strong></p>\n<p>These are Composites of two strategies that don't aim to achieve dormancy by keeping their hosts dominant until any own parasites have gone extinct. Instead the idea is that if two independent strategies achieve common dominance, it is less likely that both of their parasites survive. You could obviously increase the number of strategies, but this will create some problems I'll talk more about later. First of all, let us assume a 50-50 tandem of TFT-2D and UtopiaBot, the latter being an imaginary strategy that has no parasites and scores high against itself. Both strategies are highly efficient and will soon eliminate TFT-0D and TFT-1D, but TFT-3D will survive. However, TFT-3D will be unable to achive dominance, since the situation is basically that it can only feed on TFT-2D which makes up only half of the tandem's population, while it still has to deal with UtopiaBot which it is not designed for.</p>\n<p>Of course there is a big issue with Independent Tandems: You need to find two somewhat successful strategies with different parasites who score reasonably high against themselves as well as against each other. An obvious candidate for this would be a tandem of an Efficient CliqueBot like TFT-D3C and a regular CliqueBot that continues to cooperate after a single opponent retaliation and defects on the last turns, like 1/TFT-3D. This CliqueBot would cooperate until the end if the initial defection was not met by retaliation (facing the sibling) and TFT-D3C would cooperate until the end if the opponent defected only on the identification turn which it would not retaliate against.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Composite Strategies: Parasite Killer Tandems</strong></p>\n<p>Another option would be a tandem of two strategies of which one is the parasite of the other's parasite, e.g. TFT-2D and TFT-D3C, the latter taking care of both TFT-3D and TFT-D2C. Here, the Efficient CliqueBot TFT-D3C would revert to cooperation if the defections on the 3rd and 4th last turns have not been met by retaliation, effectively turning it into TFT-2D2C, and TFT-2D would not retaliate after defections on these turns. The main problem with Parasite Killer Tandems like these is that a singleton TFT-2D will also profit from TFT- 2D2C killing TFT-3D strategies. This is somewhat offset by TFT- 2D2C also slowly killing singleton TFT-2D, but possibly not enough to prohibit TFT-3D from feeding on it. This depends on the strategies in the tandem and the amount of surviving parasites. In addition, the parasite killer's parasite (in this case TFT-D2CD) may prove a problem as well as parasites of both strategies (TFT-4D), although these should be pretty low in numbers at that point, probably unable to achieve dominance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Composite Strategies: Random CliqueBots</strong></p>\n<p>A Composite can consist of an arbitrary high number of strategies, combining Parasite Killers with independent strategies. The only limitations are the effectiveness of the individual strategies and the ability of these strategies to score high against each other, although the latter is not so much a problem as coop-defect loses only 1 point.</p>\n<p>In fact coop-defect is so much superior to defect-defect that this brings us to another kind of Composite strategies: Random CliqueBots, which are basically i/TFT-nD CliqueBots with randomized i. For example, if i ranges from 1 to 10, this strategy wouldn't retaliate against an opponent's first defection on either of turns 1 to 10, thus reducing point loss from identifying clones/siblings. With increasing ranges of i, point loss approaches 1 which is much lower than the 6 points lost by regular CliqueBots with fixed i.</p>\n<p>Random CliqueBot vs Efficient CliqueBot dominance ratio:</p>\n<p>TFT-D3C vs TFT-D3C = -3 : -3<br />1-&infin;/TFT-4D vs TFT-D3C = -13 : -13<br />1-&infin;/TFT-4D vs TFT-D3C = -13 : -13<br />1-&infin;/TFT-4D vs 1-&infin;/TFT-4D = +3 : -4</p>\n<p>Which nets -27 : -32. However, as TFT-D3C always scores 1 point higher against TFT-nD and other TFT-DnC strategies than 1-&infin;/TFT-4D does, the winner of this duel will depend heavily on the pool of submitted strategies.</p>\n<p>In any case, this concludes Composite strategies, so let's get on with finding some replacements for boring ol' TFT.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>CRD vs TFT</strong></p>\n<p>In the late game, TFT is successful because it doesn't defect first while its ability to retaliate becomes very unimportant except during the very last turns. On the other hand, TFT is successful in the early game because it doesn't let strategies like DefectBots take too much advantage of it while maximising points gained from other nice strategies. But maybe there are other strategies with these same qualities that don't turn into a bloody mess after one random defection or score higher against RandomBots? Here's a very interesting observation for all of you that no one seems to have noticed, and I wouldn't have noticed it either had I not been specifically looking for it. Anyway, this is the observation: In both round-robin tournaments of the control group, the highest finishing TFT-0D variant is C6. Any strategies that finished higher were either TFT-1D or TFT-2D variants. And what is C6?</p>\n<p>It is a strategy that always forgives the opponent's first defection.</p>\n<p>Had C6 defected on the last two turns, I suspect it would have dominated the tournament until the emergence of TFT-3D, i.e. won the 100 generations tournament. Had it been a forgiving TFT-D3C, it would have won the 1000 generations tournament. There were other strategies that had a chance of forgiving, but they did that on <em>every</em> defection, allowing DefectBots and RandomBots to trample all over them (like TF2T).</p>\n<p>In order to maximise gain from RandomBots and other insane strategies, it might also be worth to switch to DefectBot after a total of three or two subsequent opponent's defections. For the sake of simplicity and three-letter acronyms I call this strategy CRD (Cooperate, Retaliate, Defect).</p>\n<p>Should CRD prove to outperform TFT in the early game, any other strategy would get one early defection for free, which is pretty much parasite CliqueBot heaven. On the other hand, CRD strategies would be able to feed on any Random CliqueBots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Final Remarks</strong></p>\n<p>This pretty much concludes my thoughts on the theoretical nature of the selective Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. As I see it, the strategies with the highest chance of success are:</p>\n<p>Efficient CliqueBots:<br />Might work if the correct host is chosen and no true parasites are present.&nbsp;If there is a good chance that other participants will come to the same conclusion regarding the host while it is unlikely for any of the strategy's parasites to be able to survive, it might be beneficial to experiment with TFT variants such as CRD in order to maximise early game growth. This is what gave I the lasting advantage over C4 in the thousand generations tournament.</p>\n<p>Regular CliqueBots:<br />Might work if there is a high number of Efficient CliqueBots hindering each other's process, especially if there are also specialized parasites of those. Regular CliqueBots will also have an advantage if there are lots of forgiving strategies.</p>\n<p>Parasite Killer Tandems:<br />Might work if the correct parasite is chosen as a host and no parasites of the parasite killer survive.</p>\n<p>Random CliqueBots:<br />Will most likely work, except if there are early dominant Efficient CliqueBot strategies on which the Random CliqueBot cannot feed, or if dominant strategies are of the forgiving (CRD) kind.</p>\n<p>Regular TFT-nD strategies will be exterminated by Efficient CliqueBots.</p>\n<p>There also are a few general guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any strategy needs to be carefully designed, which for (non-Efficient) CliqueBots includes forgiving after opponent retaliaton as well as&nbsp;updating the identity of the opponent in case of defections before or after the identification turn.</li>\n<li>CliqueBots and Composites should not&nbsp;waste a single point when identifying clones, siblings and aliens.</li>\n<li>Any strategy needs to score against any other strategy at least as high&nbsp;as any potential competitors score against that strategy, including most importantly the competitor itself.</li>\n<li>Any strategy needs to score against itself as high as possible.</li>\n<li>It is not necessary or important to win direct encounters if the guidelines above are followed.</li>\n<li>The probability that I have made not a single arithmetic error in all of this post is pretty low, so double-checking the calculations relevant to the strategy in question seems rational.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please also see <a href=\"/lw/7l3/fixedlength_selective_iterative_prisoners_dilemma/4tqe\">this comment</a> for graphical comparison of some of the discussed

href=\"/lw/to/the_truly_iterated_prisoners_dilemma/\">Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma</a>.</em></p>\n<p>I recently stumbled upon the <a href=\"/lw/7f2/prisoners_dilemma_tournament_results/\">selective IPD tournament results</a>, and while I was very interested in the <a href=\"/lw/79r/prisoners_dilemma_as_a_game_theory_laboratory/\">general concept</a> I was also very disappointed by the strategies that were submitted, especially considering this is Less Wrong we are talking about.</p>\n<p>This post is designed to help people who are interested in IPD problems to come up with possibly successful strategies; hopefully the same effect another couple of tournaments would have, just in a shorter period of time. All of the following is written with the tournament rules in mind, with scores depicted as deviations of matches with full mutual cooperation since the actual number of turns per match is arbitrary anyway. Also, the hypothetical objective is not to have the highest population after a certain number of generations, but to achieve lasting superiority eventually while treating near-clones that behave exactly the same in the late game as one single strategy. The results of tournaments with a very limited number of generations depend way too much on the pool of submitted strategies to be of general interest, in my opinion.</p>\n<p>This post starts out with practical observations and some universal rules and gets increasingly theoretical. Here is a short glossary of terms I presume known:</p>\n<p><em>Feeding</em> on a strategy: Scoring higher against that strategy in a match than against itself.<br><em>Outperforming</em> a strategy: Outscoring that strategy over the course of matches against all other strategies in the pool according to populations, including each other and themselves (i.e. improving the population ratio).<br><em>Dominance</em>: More than 50% of the total population.<br><em>Dormant</em> strategy: A strategy that will achieve dominance at some point but hasn't done so yet.<br><em>Extinction</em>: Asymptotical approach to 0% percent of the total population, or actual extinction in case of integer truncation.<br><em>TFT-nD</em>: A TFT strategy that defects from the nth last turn on, so TFT-0D is vanilla TFT.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: There is only very basic mathematics and logical reasoning in this post, so if anything seems confusing, it must be me using the wrong words (I'm not a native speaker). Please point out any of these cases so that I can correct them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Survival_And_Dominance\">Survival And Dominance</strong></p>\n<p>Let us assume a scenario with only two strategies, one of them dominating which we call X, the other one A.</p>\n<p>Survival Rule:<br><em>For A in this scenario not to go extinct regardless of initial population, it must score at least equally high against X as X does against itself, and if it doesn't score higher, it must score at least equally high against itself as X does against itself while not losing direct encounters.</em></p>\n<p>Let us assume X is TFT-0D and A is TFT-1D, in which case the numbers are as follows:</p>\n<p>TFT-0D vs TFT-0D = &nbsp; 0 : &nbsp;0<br>TFT-1D vs TFT-0D = +3 : -4</p>\n<p>The survival ratio is +3 : 0. Therefore, in any situation with only TFT and TFT-1D, the latter cannot go extinct. This still doesn't tell us anything about what's needed for achieving dominance, so let's get on with that.</p>\n<p>Dominance rule:<br><em>For any strategy to achieve dominance in a two-strategy situation where its survival is guaranteed according to the survival rule or where both strategies initially make up for half of the total population, it needs to outscore the other strategy over the course of these four matches:<br>X vs X<br>A vs X (2x)<br>A vs A</em></p>\n<p>Let us again do the numbers with TFT-0D and TFT-1D:</p>\n<p>TFT-0D vs TFT-0D = &nbsp; 0 : 0<br>TFT-1D vs TFT-0D = +3 : -4<br>TFT-1D vs TFT-0D = +3 : -4<br>TFT-1D vs TFT-1D = &nbsp;-3 : -3</p>\n<p>On aggregate, the dominance ratio is 0 : -8. Therefore, TFT-1D will achieve dominance.</p>\n<p>The conditions for A to exterminate the formerly dominant strategy X follow directly from the conditions for avoiding extinction, and since being the only surviving strategy is not the objective anyway they aren't interesting at this point.</p>\n<p>Threshold rule:<br><em>If A fulfills the conditions for dominance but not the conditions for survival (i.e. it scores less against X than X does against itself), it will need a certain threshold to avoid extinction and achieve dominance.</em></p>\n<p>Thresholds vary from strategy to strategy, but are obviously always below 50%. The more balanced the survival ratio is, the higher the threshold. In most cases though, the threshold is much too low to be of any relevance in a selective tournament.</p>\n<p>You can easily see that any TFT-nD will be dominated by n+1. However, with increasing n the strategy will score lower&nbsp;not only&nbsp;against itself, but also against any TFT-mD with m &lt;= n-2, which makes TFT-nD with large n very unsuccessful in the early generations of the tournament.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"A_Word_About_Afterparty\">A Word About Afterparty</strong></p>\n<p>The logical solution to this problem are \"Afterparty\" strategies that are essentially TFT-nD CliqueBots that return to cooperating if their opponent defected first on the same turn as them. I refer to these strategies as Efficient CliqueBots for reasons that will become apparent later on.</p>\n<p>The \"Afterparty\" strategy suggested on Less Wrong first defects on the sixth last turn, I will therefore call it TFT-D5C from here on. In a TFT-nD dominated tournament, however, TFT-D5C is not the optimum, as you can check by doing the math above. The optimum is in fact TFT-D3C, because it is the TFT-DnC with the lowest n that can exterminate any TFT-DmC with m &gt; n (if the other strategy falls below a certain threshold) as well as dominate any TFT-mD with m &gt;= n - 2 (if it reaches a certain threshold). This means that in a tournament similar to the control group tournament over 1000 generations, it would eventually achieve domination since it is safe from extinction due to scoring equally high respectively higher against TFT-2D and TFT-3D than those score against themselves while winning direct encounters and scoring higher against itself anyway (survival rule):</p>\n<p>TFT-DnC vs TFT-DnC = -3 : -3</p>\n<p>TFT-2D vs TFT-2D = -6 : -6<br>TFT-D3C vs TFT-2D = -6 : -13</p>\n<p>TFT-3Dvs TFT-3D = -9 : -9<br>TFT-D3C vs TFT-3D = -6 : -13</p>\n<p>Also, it outscores TFT-4D (-32 : -38) and TFT-5D (-38 : -48):</p>\n<p>TFT-4D vs TFT-4D = -12 : -12<br>TFT-D3C vs TFT-4D = -13 : -6<br>TFT-D3C vs TFT-4D = -13 : -6<br>TFT-D3C vs TFT-D3C = -3 : -3</p>\n<p>TFT-5D vs TFT-5D = -15 : -15<br>TFT-D3C vs TFT-5D = -16 : -9<br>TFT-D3C vs TFT-5D = -16 : -9<br>TFT-D3C vs TFT-D3C = -3 : -3</p>\n<p>This means that in a situation where TFT-D3C is initially equally well represented as TFT-4D or TFT-5D, it will eventually outperform those (not taking into account TFT-5D feeding on TFT-4D if both are present).</p>\n<p>In any situation with only two strategies both being TFT-DnC variants, TFT-D3C will exterminate any other TFT-DnC strategies once that strategy falls below a certain threshold, because no other TFT-DnC strategy can score higher against TFT-D3C or itself than TFT-D3C does against itself. This is trivially true for all TFT-DnC strategies starting from n = 2:</p>\n<p>TFT-D2C vs TFT-D2C = -3 : -3<br>TFT-D3C vs TFT-D2C = -6 : -13</p>\n<p>The threshold decreases for increasing n.</p>\n<p>TFT-D3C is also certain to gain a better start than any other TFT-DnC strategies with n &gt; 3 due to higher gain from TFT-nD strategies with n &lt;= 3 that dominate the early game. TFT-D1C is essentially the same as TFT-1D and equally outperformed by TFT-2D, while TFT-D2C cannot prevent TFT-D3C from crossing its threshold as TFT-D3C can feed on TFT-2D as well as on TFT-3D / TFT-D2C. This pretty much leaves TFT-D3C as the only viable TFT-DnC strategy to survive in a selective tournament of this kind. However this doesn't take into account true parasites which I will talk more about later.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"CliqueBots\">CliqueBots</strong></p>\n<p>CliqueBots have faired very poorly in this tournament, however that is mostly because they have been very poorly designed. A CliqueBot that needs five defections to identify a clone is doomed from the start, and any strategy that turns into DefectBot after identifying an alien strategy before the last turns is very doomed anyway. It seems that even though participants anticipated TFT-1D and even TFT-2D, no one considered cooperative CliqueBots a possible solution, which is surprising. So let me introduce a CliqueBot that could technically be considered another optimum of TFT-DnC, although it behaves slightly different (it is not an Efficient CliqueBot). The main idea is to defect on the very first turn and cooperate if the opponent's previous move matches its own previous move, i.e. if facing a clone, and playing TFT-2D or TFT-3D otherwise. Also in case the game begins with defect-coop followed by coop-defect, the CliqueBot will cooperate for a second time, since the opponent can be considered a TFT variant and a high number of mutual cooperations is benefitial. To keep the name short and follow the established naming system, I will from here on refer to CliqueBot strategies that defect once on turn i and otherwise behave pretty much as TFT-nD strategies as i/TFT-nD.</p>\n<p>Some comparison with selected strategies as described in the rules for dominance (four matches each):</p>\n<p>1/TFT-3D vs TFT-0D = -14 : -22<br>1/TFT-3D vs TFT-1D = -14 : -28<br>1/TFT-3D vs TFT-2D = -14 : -34<br>1/TFT-3D vs TFT-3D = -26 : -38<br>1/TFT-3D vs TFT-4D = -34 : -38<br>1/TFT-3D vs TFT-5D = -40 : -50</p>\n<p>However, the survival of any 1/TFT-nD is guaranteed only against TFT-mD with m = n-1. In addition, any TFT-DmC with m &gt;= n-1 will outperform 1/TFT-nD, so 1/TFT-nD (or any other i/TFT-nD for that matter) cannot prevail.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Parasites__Identification_And_Efficient_CliqueBots\">Parasites, Identification And Efficient CliqueBots</strong></p>\n<p>A true parasite is any strategy that pretends to be a clone of its host until the last possible opportunity of gainful defection. TFT is essentially a CliqueBot that identifies its clones by sustained cooperation, and TFT-1D is a parasite of TFT as TFT-2D is of TFT-1D and so on.</p>\n<p>Parasite rule:<br><em>Since parasites trade points gained from encounters with clones for points gained from encounters with hosts, parasites can never go extinct in a scenario with only them and their hosts, no matter how little their population. Any parasite will also ultimatively achieve dominance in these scenarios, because the points gained from one-sided defection (+7) are more than the points lost from mutual defection (-3).</em></p>\n<p>Of which follows the dormancy rule:<br><em>A strategy can only win an open-ended selective IPD tournament if it stays dormant until its own parasite has gone extinct.</em></p>\n<p>This means that theoretically any parasite only needs to survive long enough until it is the only strategy left besides its host to achieve ultimate victory, as was the case with TFT-3D, parasite of TFT-2D in the thousand generations tournament. This can easily be achieved if the host is the dominant strategy, because the parasite is better equipped to feed on the host than any other strategy in the pool, which is a guarantee of survival. However, the situation becomes very difficult for a parasite of a parasite of a dominant host in the early game, which is why TFT-4D is probably the highest TFT-nD able to survive and therefore to achieve dominance in this kind of tournament with integer rounding.</p>\n<p>This brings us back to Efficient CliqueBots. All CliqueBots, including vanilla TFT, use identification patterns to identify clones in order to maximise total point gain. Parasites make use of these patterns in order to pretend to be their hosts and maximise their own point gain. Nice CliqueBots like vanilla TFT identify their clones by continuous cooperation, which makes them unable to identify other nice CliqueBots as non-clones. This is why TFT can't ever defect on the last turn when facing CooperateBot and why nice CliqueBots aren't usually considered \"real\" CliqueBots. Non-nice CliqueBots detect clones by mutual defections at fixed identification turns, and cooperate from there on if facing a clone in order to maximise total point gain and avoid the danger of losing points in the late game. So what's better than a parasite of a dominant host? Well obviously a parasite of a dominant host that's also a CliqueBot - because that's what TFT-DnC strategies are, Efficient CliqueBots.</p>\n<p>The decisive feature of Efficient CliqueBots is that their identification turn is late enough so that in case of an alien opponent, they can simply continue defecting until the end, maximizing their efficiency and allowing them to perform better against TFT-nD strategies with higher n. Now the funny thing is that for example TFT-3D is a parasite of not only TFT-2D, but also TFT-D2C, which is what makes TFT-D3C the optimal TFT-DnC because it still outperforms TFT-4D. But is TFT-4D really the optimal parasite of TFT-D3C? Obviously not, because that would be TFT-D2CD - an Efficient CliqueBot parasite of an Efficient CliqueBot parasite (TFT-D3C) of a parasite (TFT-3D) of a parasite (TFT-2D) of a parasite (TFT-1D) of a nice CliqueBot (TFT-0D). According to the parasite rule, in a scenario with only TFT-D3C and TFT-D2CD, the latter will ultimately achieve dominance. Of course it has its own parasite in TFT-DC2D, which in turn has its own parasite TFT-2D2C, which is the host of TFT-2DCD, host of TFT-4D. And TFT-D4C and so on until DefectBot. Obviously DefectBot isn't the solution, it's only a solution to one specific strategy. So what is the solution? Well that mostly depends on the pool of submitted strategies, but the Efficient CliqueBot TFT-D3C still seems a pretty good guess.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Composite_Strategies__Parasite_Host_Tandems\">Composite Strategies: Parasite-Host Tandems</strong></p>\n<p>So how can we make sure our parasite strategy stays dormant long enough? Well there's one less-than obvious choice, which is to turn it into a Composite strategy. A Composite is pretty much what the name says: At the beginning of each match, with some probability execute strategy A, else execute strategy B. For example, a parasite could with 99% probability execute its host's strategy (e.g. TFT-0D), and with 1% execute the actual parasite strategy (TFT-1D). This would in most cases result in the death of the parasite's parasite (TFT-2D) while still resulting in absolute dominance, albeit very slowly. However this would obviously allow a singleton TFT-1D to feed on the Composite as well as on singleton TFT-0D, achieving dominance very quickly, while at the same time feeding TFT-2D. So 1% doesn't seem to be the ideal percentage, and TFT-2D would have been able to feed on TFT-0D anyway, so TFT-1D is a lost cause from the beginning. Also, even if there never was a singleton TFT-1D and TFT-2D, a similar tandem strategy could simply increase the percentage a bit.</p>\n<p>So let's stop talking about Parasite-Host Tandems and instead focus on other kinds of Composites that seem more promising.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Composite_Strategies__Independent_Tandems\">Composite Strategies: Independent Tandems</strong></p>\n<p>These are Composites of two strategies that don't aim to achieve dormancy by keeping their hosts dominant until any own parasites have gone extinct. Instead the idea is that if two independent strategies achieve common dominance, it is less likely that both of their parasites survive. You could obviously increase the number of strategies, but this will create some problems I'll talk more about later. First of all, let us assume a 50-50 tandem of TFT-2D and UtopiaBot, the latter being an imaginary strategy that has no parasites and scores high against itself. Both strategies are highly efficient and will soon eliminate TFT-0D and TFT-1D, but TFT-3D will survive. However, TFT-3D will be unable to achive dominance, since the situation is basically that it can only feed on TFT-2D which makes up only half of the tandem's population, while it still has to deal with UtopiaBot which it is not designed for.</p>\n<p>Of course there is a big issue with Independent Tandems: You need to find two somewhat successful strategies with different parasites who score reasonably high against themselves as well as against each other. An obvious candidate for this would be a tandem of an Efficient CliqueBot like TFT-D3C and a regular CliqueBot that continues to cooperate after a single opponent retaliation and defects on the last turns, like 1/TFT-3D. This CliqueBot would cooperate until the end if the initial defection was not met by retaliation (facing the sibling) and TFT-D3C would cooperate until the end if the opponent defected only on the identification turn which it would not retaliate against.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Composite_Strategies__Parasite_Killer_Tandems\">Composite Strategies: Parasite Killer Tandems</strong></p>\n<p>Another option would be a tandem of two strategies of which one is the parasite of the other's parasite, e.g. TFT-2D and TFT-D3C, the latter taking care of both TFT-3D and TFT-D2C. Here, the Efficient CliqueBot TFT-D3C would revert to cooperation if the defections on the 3rd and 4th last turns have not been met by retaliation, effectively turning it into TFT-2D2C, and TFT-2D would not retaliate after defections on these turns. The main problem with Parasite Killer Tandems like these is that a singleton TFT-2D will also profit from TFT- 2D2C killing TFT-3D strategies. This is somewhat offset by TFT- 2D2C also slowly killing singleton TFT-2D, but possibly not enough to prohibit TFT-3D from feeding on it. This depends on the strategies in the tandem and the amount of surviving parasites. In addition, the parasite killer's parasite (in this case TFT-D2CD) may prove a problem as well as parasites of both strategies (TFT-4D), although these should be pretty low in numbers at that point, probably unable to achieve dominance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Composite_Strategies__Random_CliqueBots\">Composite Strategies: Random CliqueBots</strong></p>\n<p>A Composite can consist of an arbitrary high number of strategies, combining Parasite Killers with independent strategies. The only limitations are the effectiveness of the individual strategies and the ability of these strategies to score high against each other, although the latter is not so much a problem as coop-defect loses only 1 point.</p>\n<p>In fact coop-defect is so much superior to defect-defect that this brings us to another kind of Composite strategies: Random CliqueBots, which are basically i/TFT-nD CliqueBots with randomized i. For example, if i ranges from 1 to 10, this strategy wouldn't retaliate against an opponent's first defection on either of turns 1 to 10, thus reducing point loss from identifying clones/siblings. With increasing ranges of i, point loss approaches 1 which is much lower than the 6 points lost by regular CliqueBots with fixed i.</p>\n<p>Random CliqueBot vs Efficient CliqueBot dominance ratio:</p>\n<p>TFT-D3C vs TFT-D3C = -3 : -3<br>1-\u221e/TFT-4D vs TFT-D3C = -13 : -13<br>1-\u221e/TFT-4D vs TFT-D3C = -13 : -13<br>1-\u221e/TFT-4D vs 1-\u221e/TFT-4D = +3 : -4</p>\n<p>Which nets -27 : -32. However, as TFT-D3C always scores 1 point higher against TFT-nD and other TFT-DnC strategies than 1-\u221e/TFT-4D does, the winner of this duel will depend heavily on the pool of submitted strategies.</p>\n<p>In any case, this concludes Composite strategies, so let's get on with finding some replacements for boring ol' TFT.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"CRD_vs_TFT\">CRD vs TFT</strong></p>\n<p>In the late game, TFT is successful because it doesn't defect first while its ability to retaliate becomes very unimportant except during the very last turns. On the other hand, TFT is successful in the early game because it doesn't let strategies like DefectBots take too much advantage of it while maximising points gained from other nice strategies. But maybe there are other strategies with these same qualities that don't turn into a bloody mess after one random defection or score higher against RandomBots? Here's a very interesting observation for all of you that no one seems to have noticed, and I wouldn't have noticed it either had I not been specifically looking for it. Anyway, this is the observation: In both round-robin tournaments of the control group, the highest finishing TFT-0D variant is C6. Any strategies that finished higher were either TFT-1D or TFT-2D variants. And what is C6?</p>\n<p>It is a strategy that always forgives the opponent's first defection.</p>\n<p>Had C6 defected on the last two turns, I suspect it would have dominated the tournament until the emergence of TFT-3D, i.e. won the 100 generations tournament. Had it been a forgiving TFT-D3C, it would have won the 1000 generations tournament. There were other strategies that had a chance of forgiving, but they did that on <em>every</em> defection, allowing DefectBots and RandomBots to trample all over them (like TF2T).</p>\n<p>In order to maximise gain from RandomBots and other insane strategies, it might also be worth to switch to DefectBot after a total of three or two subsequent opponent's defections. For the sake of simplicity and three-letter acronyms I call this strategy CRD (Cooperate, Retaliate, Defect).</p>\n<p>Should CRD prove to outperform TFT in the early game, any other strategy would get one early defection for free, which is pretty much parasite CliqueBot heaven. On the other hand, CRD strategies would be able to feed on any Random CliqueBots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Final_Remarks\">Final Remarks</strong></p>\n<p>This pretty much concludes my thoughts on the theoretical nature of the selective Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. As I see it, the strategies with the highest chance of success are:</p>\n<p>Efficient CliqueBots:<br>Might work if the correct host is chosen and no true parasites are present.&nbsp;If there is a good chance that other participants will come to the same conclusion regarding the host while it is unlikely for any of the strategy's parasites to be able to survive, it might be beneficial to experiment with TFT variants such as CRD in order to maximise early game growth. This is what gave I the lasting advantage over C4 in the thousand generations tournament.</p>\n<p>Regular CliqueBots:<br>Might work if there is a high number of Efficient CliqueBots hindering each other's process, especially if there are also specialized parasites of those. Regular CliqueBots will also have an advantage if there are lots of forgiving strategies.</p>\n<p>Parasite Killer Tandems:<br>Might work if the correct parasite is chosen as a host and no parasites of the parasite killer survive.</p>\n<p>Random CliqueBots:<br>Will most likely work, except if there are early dominant Efficient CliqueBot strategies on which the Random CliqueBot cannot feed, or if dominant strategies are of the forgiving (CRD) kind.</p>\n<p>Regular TFT-nD strategies will be exterminated by Efficient CliqueBots.</p>\n<p>There also are a few general guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any strategy needs to be carefully designed, which for (non-Efficient) CliqueBots includes forgiving after opponent retaliaton as well as&nbsp;updating the identity of the opponent in case of defections before or after the identification turn.</li>\n<li>CliqueBots and Composites should not&nbsp;waste a single point when identifying clones, siblings and aliens.</li>\n<li>Any strategy needs to score against any other strategy at least as high&nbsp;as any potential competitors score against that strategy, including most importantly the competitor itself.</li>\n<li>Any strategy needs to score against itself as high as possible.</li>\n<li>It is not necessary or important to win direct encounters if the guidelines above are followed.</li>\n<li>The probability that I have made not a single arithmetic error in all of this post is pretty low, so double-checking the calculations relevant to the strategy in question seems rational.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please also see <a href=\"/lw/7l3/fixedlength_selective_iterative_prisoners_dilemma/4tqe\">this comment</a> for graphical comparison of some of the discussed strategies.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a few selected strategies written in pseudocode, with n being&nbsp;the number of turns per match:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Efficient_CliqueBot__TFT_D3C\">Efficient CliqueBot: TFT-D3C</strong></p>\n<p>Cooperation on first turn.<br>Continue with TFT.<br>If opponent defects on any of turns 1 to n-4:<br>&nbsp;

Opening:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is a platitude among decision theorists that agents should choose their&nbsp;actions so as to maximize expected value. But exactly how to define&nbsp;expected value is contentious. Evidential decision theory (henceforth&nbsp;EDT), causal decision theory (henceforth CDT), and a theory proposed&nbsp;by Ralph Wedgwood that I will call benchmark theory (BT) all advise&nbsp;agents to maximize different types of expected value. Consequently, their&nbsp;verdicts sometimes conflict. In certain famous cases of conflict &mdash; medical&nbsp;Newcomb problems &mdash; CDT and BT seem to get things right, while EDT&nbsp;seems to get things wrong. In other cases of conflict, including some&nbsp;recent examples suggested by Egan 2007, EDT and BT seem to get things&nbsp;right, while CDT seems to get things wrong. In still other cases, EDT and&nbsp;CDT seem to get things right, while BT gets things wrong.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no accident, I claim, that all three decision theories are subject&nbsp;to counterexamples. Decision rules can be reinterpreted as voting rules,&nbsp;where the voters are the agent&rsquo;s possible future selves. The problematic&nbsp;examples have the structure of voting paradoxes. Just as voting paradoxes&nbsp;show that no voting rule can do everything we want, decision-theoretic&nbsp;paradoxes show that no decision rule can do everything we want. Luckily, the so-called &ldquo;tickle defense&rdquo; establishes that EDT, CDT, and BT will do&nbsp;everything we want in a wide range of situations. Most decision situations,&nbsp;I argue, are analogues of voting situations in which the voters unanimously&nbsp;adopt the same set of preferences. In such situations, all plausible voting&nbsp;rules and all plausible decision rules agree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

Measuring Inaccuracy</a></p>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the fundamental problems of epistemology is to say when the evidence in an&nbsp;agent&rsquo;s possession justi\ufb01es the beliefs she holds. In this paper and its sequel, we defend&nbsp;the Bayesian solution to this problem by appealing to the following fundamental norm:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Accuracy: An epistemic agent ought to minimize the inaccuracy of her partial&nbsp;beliefs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this paper, we make this norm mathematically precise in various ways. We describe three epistemic dilemmas that an agent might face if she attempts to follow Accuracy, and&nbsp;we show that the only inaccuracy measures that do not give rise to such dilemmas are the&nbsp;quadratic inaccuracy measures. In the sequel, we derive the main tenets of Bayesianism&nbsp;from the relevant mathematical versions of Accuracy to which this characterization of the&nbsp;legitimate inaccuracy measures gives rise, but we also show that unless the requirement&nbsp;of Rigidity is imposed from the start, Je\ufb00rey conditionalization has to be replaced by a&nbsp;di\ufb00erent method of update in order for Accuracy to be satis\ufb01ed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Leitgeb-Pettigrew-An-objective-justification-of-Bayesianism-II-the-consequences-of-minimizing-inaccuracy.pdf\">An Objective Defense of Bayesianism II: The Consequences of Minimizing Inaccuracy</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<p>In this article and its prequel, we derive Bayesianism from the following norm: Accuracy&mdash;an agent ought to minimize the inaccuracy of her partial beliefs. In the prequel,&nbsp;we make the norm mathematically precise; in this article, we derive its consequences.&nbsp;We show that the two core tenets of Bayesianism follow from Accuracy, while the&nbsp;characteristic claim of Objective Bayesianism follows from Accuracy together with an&nbsp;extra assumption. Finally, we show that Jeffrey Conditionalization violates Accuracy&nbsp;unless Rigidity is assumed, and we describe the alternative updating rule that Accuracy&nbsp;mandates in the absence of Rigidity.</p>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Richard Pettigrew has also written an excellent introduction to <a href=\"http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~rp3959/papers/interpsprobart6.pdf\">probability</a>.</p>",

style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Some part of me has always wanted to be a doctor. Sure, when I was six, that was said with the same youthful naivety with which so many children say it. Over the years, that drive has waxed and waned, but I never entirely let go of it. As I grew up, I became more and more interested in the sciences, but I enjoyed everything; I couldn&rsquo;t narrow it down to just one field. In college, I looked for research opportunities everywhere I could. I tremendously enjoyed working in both of the labs in which I worked, but while cogently I understood that the research I was working on was an important part of medicine, I wanted a more direct connection to the patients I was helping. Ultimately, I know that I want to work in a job where I have an empathic connection to the work I&rsquo;m doing. I&rsquo;ve always empathized well, and I enjoy any chance I have to help someone.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">I never truly realized on a personal level how powerful such a connection is until last fall, when doctors discovered a pilocytic astrocytoma in my now-girlfriend&rsquo;s spine. Meredith&rsquo;s tumor stretched over nine vertebrae, and she was facing life-threatening spinal surgery, as well as dealing with the physical symptoms of the tumor. As I helped her cope with the stress and fear of the operation, I had the horrific realization that people actually have to go through what she was facing. Of course, I understood this on a logical level &ndash; X people are diagnosed with disease Y over given period of time Z &ndash; but I never realized until then what that could mean for them on a personal level. I couldn&rsquo;t stand the thought of anyone dealing with the emotional and physical pain that she was going through, and I knew I wanted to help other people avoid that. I realized I wouldn&rsquo;t be happy with myself if I had the option to try to help alleviate that suffering but chose a different path. I understood that medicine was exactly what I wanted to do, and for the first time in my life, I had no reservations about that.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">But beyond the empathic rewards a career in medicine would give me, I know I would enjoy and thrive in a medical environment, particularly the specialty in which I am interested, emergency medicine. I&rsquo;ve always found I&rsquo;m happiest and most successful in high-stress situations, so much so that I actively seek them out whenever I can. When my friends ask me what activities I am in and what classes I am taking, they usually wince when I tell them I am taking nineteen hours of high-level, technical sciences, working, participating in a few extracurricular activities, and managing a student-run organization with a budget of upwards of $90,000. Few people would find such a workload appealing, but I relish it. When I&rsquo;m not pushed to my limit, even if I&rsquo;m still doing a lot, I feel slothful and unproductive. I am disgusted with myself for failing to live up to my potential. Saying I enjoy a challenge would be a huge understatement, and while sometimes I have gotten in over my head, I know that I am happiest and most successful when I am right on the verge of being overwhelmed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;\">I know my drive will serve me well, both in medical school and in my future career as a physician. It borders on clich&eacute; to mention the long hours put in by medical students, residents, or even practicing physicians. And few careers are more stressful than medicine, where too many of the decisions made are life and death decisions. Medicine, particularly emergency medicine, takes someone who understands, is used to, and deals well with high pressure situations. I&rsquo;ve been seeking those out for as long as I can remember, and I know that I am that person. A commitment to a career in medicine isn&rsquo;t one to be made lightheartedly. But when I think about what Meredith had to go through over the past year, there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind about what I want to do with my life. After seeing what she dealt with, I can&rsquo;t stand by, knowing other people are struggling with the same things. Some part of me may have always wanted to be a doctor, but now, more than ever, every part does.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In particular, I feel the last line is very cliche, but honestly, I just needed to get a working version that I could start to get feedback on.

style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Some part of me has always wanted to be a doctor. Sure, when I was six, that was said with the same youthful naivety with which so many children say it. Over the years, that drive has waxed and waned, but I never entirely let go of it. As I grew up, I became more and more interested in the sciences, but I enjoyed everything; I couldn&rsquo;t narrow it down to just one field. In college, I looked for research opportunities everywhere I could. I tremendously enjoyed working in both of the labs in which I worked, but while cogently I understood that the research I was working on was an important part of medicine, I wanted a more direct connection to the patients I was helping. Ultimately, I know that I want to work in a job where I have an empathic connection to the work I&rsquo;m doing. I&rsquo;ve always empathized well, and I enjoy any chance I have to help someone.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">I never truly realized on a personal level how powerful such a connection is until last fall, when doctors discovered a pilocytic astrocytoma in my now-girlfriend&rsquo;s spine. Meredith&rsquo;s tumor stretched over nine vertebrae, and she was facing life-threatening spinal surgery, as well as dealing with the physical symptoms of the tumor. As I helped her cope with the stress and fear of the operation, I had the horrific realization that people actually have to go through what she was facing. Of course, I understood this on a logical level &ndash; X people are diagnosed with disease Y over given period of time Z &ndash; but I never realized until then what that could mean for them on a personal level. I couldn&rsquo;t stand the thought of anyone dealing with the emotional and physical pain that she was going through, and I knew I wanted to help other people avoid that. I realized I wouldn&rsquo;t be happy with myself if I had the option to try to help alleviate that suffering but chose a different path. I understood that medicine was exactly what I wanted to do, and for the first time in my life, I had no reservations about that.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">But beyond the empathic rewards a career in medicine would give me, I know I would enjoy and thrive in a medical environment, particularly the specialty in which I am interested, emergency medicine. I&rsquo;ve always found I&rsquo;m happiest and most successful in high-stress situations, so much so that I actively seek them out whenever I can. When my friends ask me what activities I am in and what classes I am taking, they usually wince when I tell them I am taking nineteen hours of high-level, technical sciences, working, participating in a few extracurricular activities, and managing a student-run organization with a budget of upwards of $90,000. Few people would find such a workload appealing, but I relish it. When I&rsquo;m not pushed to my limit, even if I&rsquo;m still doing a lot, I feel slothful and unproductive. I am disgusted with myself for failing to live up to my potential. Saying I enjoy a challenge would be a huge understatement, and while sometimes I have gotten in over my head, I know that I am happiest and most successful when I am right on the verge of being overwhelmed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;\">I know my drive will serve me well, both in medical school and in my future career as a physician. It borders on clich&eacute; to mention the long hours put in by medical students, residents, or even practicing physicians. And few careers are more stressful than medicine, where too many of the decisions made are life and death decisions. Medicine, particularly emergency medicine, takes someone who understands, is used to, and deals well with high pressure situations. I&rsquo;ve been seeking those out for as long as I can remember, and I know that I am that person. A commitment to a career in medicine isn&rsquo;t one to be made lightheartedly. But when I think about what Meredith had to go through over the past year, there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind about what I want to do with my life. After seeing what she dealt with, I can&rsquo;t stand by, knowing other people are struggling with the same things. Some part of me may have always wanted to be a doctor, but now, more than ever, every part does.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In particular, I feel the last line is very cliche, but honestly, I just needed to get a working version that I could start to get feedback on. This is a very rough draft, and any suggestions you have are very welcome.

contributions on LW. I picked up the habit of doing so for Main posts back in the Visiting Fellows program, but I've found that doing it for comments is way more informative.</p>\n<p>It forces you to build decent models of your audience and their social psychology, the game theoretic details of each particular situation, how information cascades should be expected to work, your overall memetic environment, etc. It also forces you to be reflective and to expand on your gut feeling of \"people will upvote this a lot\" or \"people will downvote this a little bit\"; it forces you to think through more specifically why you expect that, and how your contributions should be expected to shape the minds of your audience on average.</p>\n<p>It also makes it easier to notice confusion. When one of my comments gets downvoted to -6 when I expected -3 then I know some part of my model is wrong; or, as is often the case, it will get voted back up to -3 within a few hours.</p>\n<p>Having powerful intuitive models of social psychology is important for navigating disagreement. It helps you realize when people are agreeing or disagreeing for reasons they don't want to state explicitly, why they would find certain lines of argument more or less compelling, why they would feel justified in supporting or criticizing certain social norms, what underlying tensions they feel that cause them to respond in a certain way, etc, which is important for getting the maximum amount of evidence from your interactions. All the information in the world won't help you if you can't interpret it correctly.</p>\n<p>Doing it well also makes you look cool. When I write from a social psychological perspective I get significantly more karma. And I can help people express things that they don't find easy to explicitly express, which is infinitely more important than karma. When you're taking into account not only people's words but the generators of people's words you get an automatic reflectivity bonus. Obviously, looking at their actual words is a prerequisite and is also an extremely important habit of sane communication.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, gaining explicit knowledge of everyday social psychology is like explicitly understanding a huge portion of the world that you already knew. This is often a really fun experience.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of subskills necessary to do this right, but maybe doing it wrong is also informative, if you keep trying.</p>", "submitToFrontpage":

My apologies to those who did enter.</p>\n<p>After the success of prase's Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournament, a number of people expressed interest in some variations on the initial tournament, including one with a reputation system from one match to the next. I've been trying to teach myself to program over the past few months, so I thought I'd have a go at implementing it.</p>\n<p>As well as the vanilla p.d. competition, I thought I'd run a second tournament based on the game of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_%28game%29\" target=\"_blank\">chicken</a>, which is similar to p.d. but reverses the last two pay-offs, making it better (at least in the short term) to co-operate with a defector. This obviously creates a greater potential for bully strategies (although you can also bully in p.d.), so I thought it might have some interesting consequences with a reputation system.</p>\n<p>Exact rules are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Anybody who wants may enter up to one strategy in each competition (you needn't enter the same strategy in both). You may also enter only one contest if you don't want to enter both. Strategies should be entered by private message to me, and should have names. I <em>will</em> accept duplicates.</li>\n<li>Strategies should be described in English, I may need to ask for clarification. A strategy should be able to tell me whether your program co-operates or defects in any situation, and should be computable.</li>\n<li>There will be two tournaments, Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken. Each tournament will divide up into matches, and each match into rounds.</li>\n<li>In a round each strategy chooses which to co-operate or defect. The pay-offs for Prisoner's Dilemma are the same as the previous tournament, 4 each if both co-operate, 1 each if both defect otherwise 7 for the defector and 0 for the co-operator. In Chicken the mutual defection pay-off is replaced with a 7 point penalty, the other pay-offs are unchanged.</li>\n<li>In order to make its decision, each strategy is allowed to know the entire history of this match, as well as any prior matches which included either it or its opponent. It does not have access to any other matches, to its opponents identity or to its opponents source code.</li>\n<li>Each match has its length determined by an exponential distribution with each round having a 1% chance of being the last. At the end of the tournament, scores will be adjusted to make up for some programs playing more rounds than others (specifically, your score will be multiplied by the average number of rounds played and divided by the number of rounds you played)</li>\n<li>The tournament will be done as a Round Robin, with matches performed serially so there will usually be previous results to judge by. If I have time I will also try an evolutionary variation.</li>\n<li>In addition to the strategies submitted by players, I will add an automatic co-operator, an automatic defector and a random strategy (with equal chance of co-operating or defecting on any round).</li>\n<li>Names of authors will be revealed by default, if you don't want yours revealed then ask.</li>\n<li>I have created a poll in the comments about where people want the results posted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Deadline for entry is 21st September. If I get fewer than 8 I won't run it, if I get more than 30 I'll run it with the first 30, so don't delay.</p>\n<p>EDIT: To clarify for any who were confused, each strategy has access to all of its own matches and all of its opponents matches, not just matches between itself and its opponent.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null,

href=\"/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/\">fun theory sequence</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The arrow of human history&hellip;points towards larger quantities of non-zero-sumness. As history progresses, human beings find themselves playing non-zero-sum games with more and more other human beings. Interdependence expands, and social complexity grows in scope and depth.&rdquo; (Robert Wright, <em>Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny.)</em></p>\n<p>What does it mean for a human society to be more complex? Where does new information come from, and where in the system is it stored? What does it mean for everyday people to live in a simple versus a complex society?</p>\n<p>There are certain kinds of complexity that are inherent in the environment: that existed before there were human societies at all, and would go on existing without those societies. Even the simplest human society needs to be able to adapt to these factors in order to survive. For example: climate and weather are necessary features of the planet, and humans still spend huge amounts of resources dealing with changing seasons, droughts, and the extremes of heat and cold. Certain plants grow in certain types of soil, and different animals have different migratory patterns. Even the most basic hunter-gatherer groups needed to store and pass on knowledge of these patterns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But even early human societies had a lot more than the <em>minimum </em>amount of knowledge required to live in a particular environment. Cultural complexity, in the form of traditions, conventions, rituals, and social roles, added to technological complexity, in the form of tools designed for particular purposes. Living in an agricultural society with division of labour and various different social roles required children to <em>learn </em>more than if they had been born to a small hunter-gatherer band. And although everyone in a village might have the same <em>knowledge about the world</em>, it was (probably) no longer possible for all the procedural skills taught and passed on in a given group to be mastered by a single person. (Imagine learning all the skills to be a farmer, carpenter, metalworker, weaver, baker, potter, and probably a half-dozen other things.)</p>\n<p>This would have been the real beginning of Robert Wright&rsquo;s interdependence and non-zero-sum interactions. No individual could possess <em>all </em>of the knowledge/complexity of their society, but every individual would benefit from its existence, at the price of a slightly longer education or apprenticeship than their counterparts in hunter-gather groups. The complexity was <em>hidden</em>; a person could wear a robe without knowing how to weave it, and a clay bowl without knowing how to shape it or bake it in a kiln. There was room for that knowledge in other people&rsquo;s brains. The only downside, other than slightly longer investments in education, was a small increase in inferential distance between individuals.</p>\n<p>Writing was the next step. For the first time, a significant amount of knowledge could be stored outside of <em>anyone&rsquo;s </em>brain. Information could be passed on from one individual, the writer, to a nearly unbounded number of others, the readers. Considering the limits of human working memory, significant mathematical discoveries would have been impossible before there was a form of notation. (Imagine solving polynomial equations without pencil and paper.) And for the first time, <em>knowledge was cumulative</em>. An individual no longer had to spend a number of years mastering a particular, specific skill in an apprenticeship, having to laboriously pass on any new discoveries one at a time to their own apprentices. The new generation could <em>start </em>where the previous generation had left off. Knowledge could stay alive indefinitely, almost, in writing, without having to pass through a continuous line of minds. (Without writing, even if the ancient Greek society had possessed equivalent scientific and mathematical knowledge, it could not have later been rediscovered by any other society.) Conditions were ripe for the total sum of human knowledge to explode, and for complexity to increase rapidly.</p>\n<p>The downside was a <em>huge </em>increase in inferential distance. For the first time, not only could individuals lack a particular procedural skill, they might not even know that the skill <em>existed</em>. They might not even benefit from the fact of its existence. The stock market contains a huge amount of knowledge and complexity, and provides non-zero-sum gains to many individuals (as well as zero-sum gains to some individuals). But to understand it requires enough education and training that most individuals can&rsquo;t participate. The difference between the medical knowledge of professionals versus uneducated individuals is <em>huge</em>, and I expect that many people suffer because, although <em>someone </em>knows how they could avoid or solve their medical problems, <em>they </em>don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Computers, aside from being really nifty, are also incredibly useful, but learning to use them well is challenging enough that a lot of people, especially older people, don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>(That being said, nearly everyone in Western nations benefits from living here and now, instead of in an agricultural village 4000 years ago. Think of the complexity embodied in the justice system and the health care system, both of which make life easier and safer for nearly everyone regardless of whether they actually train as professionals in those domains. But people don&rsquo;t benefit as much as they <em>could</em>.)</p>\n<p>Is there any way to avoid this? It&rsquo;s probably impossible for an individual to have even superficial understanding in every domain of knowledge, much less the level of understanding required to <em>benefit </em>from that knowledge. Just keeping up with day-to-day life (managing finances, holding a job, and trying to socialize in an environment vastly different from the ancestral one) can be trying, especially for individuals on the lower end of the IQ bell curve. (I hate the idea of intelligence, something not under the individual&rsquo;s control and thus unfair-seeming, being that important to success, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s true.) This might be why <a href=\"/lw/6vq/on_the_unpopularity_of_cryonics_life_sucks_but_at/\">so many people are unhappy</a>. Without regressing to a less complex kind of society, is there anything we can <em>do</em>?</p>\n<p>I think the answer is quite clear, because even as societies become more complex, the arrow of daily-life-difficulty-level doesn&rsquo;t always go in the same direction. There are various examples of this; computers becoming more user-friendly with time, for example. But I&rsquo;ll use an example that comes readily to mind for <em>me</em>: automated external defibrillators, or AEDs.</p>\n<p>A defibrillator uses electricity to interrupt an abnormal heart rhythm (ventricular fibrillation is the typical example, thus <em>de</em>-fibrillation). External means that the device acts from <em>outside </em>the patient&rsquo;s body (pads with electrodes on the skin) rather than being implanted. Most defibrillators require training to use and can cause a lot of harm if they&rsquo;re used wrong. The <em>automated </em>part is what changes this. AEDs will analyze a patient&rsquo;s heart rhythm, and they will <em>only </em>shock if it is necessary. They have colorful diagrams and recorded verbal instructions. There&rsquo;s <em>probably </em>a way to use an AED wrong, but you would have to be very creative to find it. Needless to say, the technology involved is ridiculously complex and took years to develop, but you don&rsquo;t need to understand the science involved in order to use an AED. You probably don&rsquo;t even need to <em>read</em>. The complexity is neatly hidden away; all that matters is that <em>someone </em>knows it. There weren't necessarily any ground-breaking innovations involved, just the knowledge of old inventions in a user-friendly format.</p>\n<p>The difference is intelligence. An AED has some limited artificial intelligence in it, programmed in by people who knew what they were talking about, which is why it can replace the decision process that would otherwise be made by medical professionals. A book contains knowledge, but has to be read and interpreted in its entirety by a human brain. A device that has its own small brain doesn&rsquo;t. This is probably the route where our society is headed if the arrow of (technological) complexity keeps going up. Societies need to be livable for human beings.</p>\n<p>That being said, there is probably such thing as <em>too </em>much hidden complexity.

The first idea is about trying out new things, like making pancakes, solving a trivial programming problem or playing the intro to \"Smoke on the Water\".&nbsp;Trying out new things is a lot of fun, but as many commenters have noted, it doesn't necessarily give you a long-term upgrade. (NB to everyone who considers me a strong rationalist: you'd change your opinion if you saw my pancakes!)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second idea is about establishing habits of practice. Some goals force you to set up a daily routine before you can achieve them. In retrospect, that daily routine always turns out to have been the main thing of value, and the actual result is almost an afterthought. For example, my routine over the last several months has looked like this: cold shower every day, jump-rope workout and drum practice every weekday, strength training twice a week, travel every weekend. Once you get into the groove, you don't wanna get out.</p>\n<p>So maybe instead of designing level 2 we could somehow incentivize each other to pick up (and keep) rigorous habits, e.g. write N words every day without exception?

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities\">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>\". This is one of the defining works of modern urban planning, and Jane Jacobs is considered one of our most important <a href=\"http://www.planetizen.com/topthinkers\">urban planning thinkers</a>.</p>\n<p>It's a fine book, but I found myself surprised at just how unimpressive it is for a work of such supposed importance. Her hypothesis is simple enough that I can summarize it here:</p>\n<p>-Cities succeed by having many people using the city streets throughout the day. Large numbers of people keep the streets safe, and provide enough traffic for businesses to thrive.</p>\n<p>-To achieve this constant stream of people, streets should have a large variety of different businesses which are utilized at different times, and should eliminate barriers that prevent the flow of people.</p>\n<p>Jacobs' reaches this hypothesis through her own observations of various cities, along with a few bits of data concerning densities, crime rates, etc. But there's no systematic examination of data, no meticulously constructed arguments, and no addressing of criticisms or alternate explanations. Evidently, all that it takes to be a great work in urban planning is the barest rudiments of basic science. (This isn't the first time I've been critical of <a href=\"/lw/2kk/book_recommendations/2ei6\">supposed great works in this field</a>.)</p>\n<p>It strikes me that, for whatever reason, Urban Planning is an&nbsp;underserved field* - the scholarship behind it doesn't compare to, say, the quality of work done in evolution, or cognitive psychology.</p>\n<p>I have my theories for why this might be**, but it got me thinking - which other fields show a distinct lack of quality work done in them? What other fields are underserved?</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>*There is of course the&nbsp;possibility&nbsp;that I'm unfamiliar with more recent, higher quality urban planning literature.</p>\n<p>**Namely, that urban planning is an offshoot of architecture, which has tended to value on aesthetic&nbsp;judgement and&nbsp;intuition&nbsp;over empiricism and rigorously constructed arguments.</p>",

The human brain&rsquo;s memory capacity is estimated at between 3 and 6 TB, and not all of that functions like RAM, and it&rsquo;s implemented in meat.)</li>\n<li>Each of the Power 750 Express servers seems to consume a maximum of 1,949 watts, making a total of 175kw for the whole computer</li>\n<li>There also appears to be a sophisticated system connected to the Jeopardy buzzer but I can&rsquo;t find power specs for that part.</li>\n<li>IBM estimates that Watson can compute at about 80 teraflops (10^12). <a href=\"http://larc.unt.edu/ian/pubs/knowledge.pdf\">This paper</a> mentions in passing that the human brain operates in the petaflop range (10^15), but at the same time, a brain is not a digital system and so the flop comparison is less meaningful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To put this in perspective, a conservative upper bound for a human being standing still is at most about 150w &mdash; less than 1/10 of 1% of Watson &mdash; and the person just holds the buzzer and operates it with a muscular control system.</p>\n<p>Each of the servers generates a maximum of 6,649 BTU/hour. Watson overall would generate about 600,000 BTU/hour and require massive amounts of air conditioning. I don&rsquo;t know a good estimate on heat removal, but it would up Watson&rsquo;s energy cost significantly.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to criticize Watson unduly; it certainly is an impressive engineering achievement and has generated a lot of good publicity and public interest in computing. The engineering feat is impressive if for no other reason than that it is the first accomplishment of this scale, and pioneering is always hard&hellip; future Watsons will be cheaper, faster, and more effective because of IBM&rsquo;s great work on this.</p>\n<p>But at the same time, the amazing power and storage costs for Watson really kind of water it down for me. I&rsquo;m not surprised that if you throw power and hardware and memory at a problem, you can use rather straightforward machine learning methods to solve it. I feel similarly about Deep Blue and chess.</p>\n<p>A Turing test that would be more impressive to me would be building something like Watson or Deep Blue that is not allowed to consume more power than an average human, and has comparable memory and speed. The reason this would be impressive is that in order to build it, you&rsquo;d have to have some way of representing data and reasoning in the system that is efficient to a similar degree that human minds are. One thing you could not do is simply concatenate an unreasonable number of large feature vectors together and overfit a machine learning model. Since this is an important open problem with lots of implications, we should use funding and publicity to drive research organizations like IBM towards that goal. Maybe building Watson is a first step and now the task is to miniaturize Watson, and in doing so, we&rsquo;ll be forced to learn about efficient brain architectures along the way.<br /><br /><br />Note: I gathered the numbers above by looking <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/what-makes-ibms-watson-run/8208\">here</a> and then scouring around for various listings of specific hardware specs.

promised joy!</p>\n<p>- <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse\">Robert Burns</a>&nbsp;(translated)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A team of decision analysts has just presented the&nbsp;results of a complex analysis to the executive responsible&nbsp;for making the decision. The analysts recommend&nbsp;making an innovative investment and claim&nbsp;that, although the investment is not without risks, it&nbsp;has a large positive expected net present value... While the analysis seems fair and unbiased, she can&rsquo;t&nbsp;help but feel a bit skeptical. Is her skepticism justified?<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a name=\"Holden\"></a>Or, suppose Holden Karnofsky of charity-evaluator <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> has been presented with a complex analysis of why an intervention that reduces existential risks from artificial intelligence has <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/7397629\">astronomical expected value</a> and is therefore the type of intervention that should receive marginal philanthropic dollars. Holden <a href=\"/lw/745/why_we_cant_take_expected_value_estimates/\">feels skeptical</a>&nbsp;about this 'explicit estimated expected value' approach; is his skepticism justified?</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>Suppose you're a business executive considering <em>n</em>&nbsp;alternatives whose 'true' expected values are<em>&nbsp;</em>&mu;<sub>1</sub>, ..., &mu;<sub>n</sub>. By 'true' expected value I mean the expected value you would calculate if you could devote unlimited time, money, and computational resources to making the expected value calculation.<sup>2</sup> But you only have three months and $50,000 with which to produce the estimate, and this limited study produces estimated expected values for the alternatives V<sub>1</sub>, ..., V<sub>n</sub>.</p>\n<p>Of course, you choose the alternative i* that has the highest estimated expected value V<sub>i*</sub>. You implement the chosen alternative, and get the realized value x<sub>i*</sub>.</p>\n<p>Let's call the difference x<sub>i*</sub> - V<sub>i*</sub> the 'postdecision surprise'.<sup>3</sup> A positive surprise means your option brought about more value than your analysis predicted; a negative surprise means you were disappointed.</p>\n<p>Assume, too kindly, that your estimates are unbiased. And suppose you use this decision procedure many times, for many different decisions, and your estimates are unbiased. It seems reasonable to expect that <em>on average</em>&nbsp;you will receive the estimated expected value of each decision you make in this way. Sometimes you'll be positively surprised, sometimes negatively surprised, but on average you should get the estimated expected value for each decision.</p>\n<p>Alas, this is not so; your outcome will usually be <em>worse</em>&nbsp;than what you predicted, even if your estimate was unbiased!</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...consider a decision problem in which there are <em>k</em>&nbsp;choices, each of which has true estimated [expected value] of 0. Suppose that the error in each [expected value] estimate has zero mean and standard deviation of 1, shown as the bold curve [below]. Now, as we actually start to generate the estimates, some of the errors will be negative (pessimistic) and some will be positive (optimistic). Because we select the action with the <em>highest</em>&nbsp;[expected value] estimate, we are obviously favoring overly optimistic estimates, and that is the source of the bias... The curve in [the figure below] for <em>k</em>&nbsp;= 3 has a mean around 0.85, so the average disappointment will be about 85% of the standard deviation in [expected value] estimates. With more choices, extremely optimistic estimates are more likely to arise: for <em>k</em>&nbsp;= 30, the disappointment will be around twice the standard deviation in the estimates.<sup>4</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/optimizers-curse.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>This is \"the optimizer's curse.\" See Smith &amp; Winkler (2006) for the proof.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>The Solution</h4>\n<p>The solution to the optimizer's curse is rather straightforward.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...[we] model the uncertainty in&nbsp;the value estimates explicitly and use Bayesian methods&nbsp;to interpret these value estimates.&nbsp;Specifically, we&nbsp;assign a prior distribution on the vector of true values&nbsp;&mu; = (&mu;<sub>1</sub>, ...,&nbsp;&mu;<sub>n</sub>) and&nbsp;describe the accuracy of the&nbsp;value estimates V = (V<sub>1</sub>, ..., V<sub>n</sub>) by a conditional&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;V|&mu;\u0001\u0001. Then, rather than ranking alternatives.&nbsp;based on the value estimates, after we have done the&nbsp;decision analysis and observed the value estimates V,&nbsp;we use Bayes&rsquo; rule to determine the posterior distribution&nbsp;for \u0001\u0001&mu;|V and rank and choose among alternatives&nbsp;based on the posterior means...</p>\n<p>The key to overcoming the optimizer&rsquo;s curse is conceptually&nbsp;very simple: treat the results of the analysis&nbsp;as uncertain and combine these results with prior&nbsp;estimates of value using Bayes&rsquo; rule before choosing&nbsp;an alternative. This process formally recognizes&nbsp;the uncertainty in value estimates and corrects for&nbsp;the bias that is built into the optimization process by&nbsp;adjusting high estimated values downward. To adjust&nbsp;values properly, we need to understand the degree&nbsp;of uncertainty in these estimates and in the true values..<sup>5</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To return to our original question: <em>Yes</em>, some skepticism is justified when considering the option before you with the highest expected value. To minimize your prediction error, treat the results of your decision analysis as uncertain and use Bayes' Theorem to combine its results with an appropriate prior.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Notes</h4>\n<p><small><sup>1</sup> Smith &amp; Winkler (2006).</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>2</sup> Lindley et al.

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse\">Robert Burns</a>&nbsp;(translated)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A team of decision analysts has just presented the&nbsp;results of a complex analysis to the executive responsible&nbsp;for making the decision. The analysts recommend&nbsp;making an innovative investment and claim&nbsp;that, although the investment is not without risks, it&nbsp;has a large positive expected net present value... While the analysis seems fair and unbiased, she can\u2019t&nbsp;help but feel a bit skeptical. Is her skepticism justified?<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a name=\"Holden\"></a>Or, suppose Holden Karnofsky of charity-evaluator <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> has been presented with a complex analysis of why an intervention that reduces existential risks from artificial intelligence has <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/7397629\">astronomical expected value</a> and is therefore the type of intervention that should receive marginal philanthropic dollars. Holden <a href=\"/lw/745/why_we_cant_take_expected_value_estimates/\">feels skeptical</a>&nbsp;about this 'explicit estimated expected value' approach; is his skepticism justified?</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>Suppose you're a business executive considering <em>n</em>&nbsp;alternatives whose 'true' expected values are<em>&nbsp;</em>\u03bc<sub>1</sub>, ..., \u03bc<sub>n</sub>. By 'true' expected value I mean the expected value you would calculate if you could devote unlimited time, money, and computational resources to making the expected value calculation.<sup>2</sup> But you only have three months and $50,000 with which to produce the estimate, and this limited study produces estimated expected values for the alternatives V<sub>1</sub>, ..., V<sub>n</sub>.</p>\n<p>Of course, you choose the alternative i* that has the highest estimated expected value V<sub>i*</sub>. You implement the chosen alternative, and get the realized value x<sub>i*</sub>.</p>\n<p>Let's call the difference x<sub>i*</sub> - V<sub>i*</sub> the 'postdecision surprise'.<sup>3</sup> A positive surprise means your option brought about more value than your analysis predicted; a negative surprise means you were disappointed.</p>\n<p>Assume, too kindly, that your estimates are unbiased. And suppose you use this decision procedure many times, for many different decisions, and your estimates are unbiased. It seems reasonable to expect that <em>on average</em>&nbsp;you will receive the estimated expected value of each decision you make in this way. Sometimes you'll be positively surprised, sometimes negatively surprised, but on average you should get the estimated expected value for each decision.</p>\n<p>Alas, this is not so; your outcome will usually be <em>worse</em>&nbsp;than what you predicted, even if your estimate was unbiased!</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...consider a decision problem in which there are <em>k</em>&nbsp;choices, each of which has true estimated [expected value] of 0. Suppose that the error in each [expected value] estimate has zero mean and standard deviation of 1, shown as the bold curve [below]. Now, as we actually start to generate the estimates, some of the errors will be negative (pessimistic) and some will be positive (optimistic). Because we select the action with the <em>highest</em>&nbsp;[expected value] estimate, we are obviously favoring overly optimistic estimates, and that is the source of the bias... The curve in [the figure below] for <em>k</em>&nbsp;= 3 has a mean around 0.85, so the average disappointment will be about 85% of the standard deviation in [expected value] estimates. With more choices, extremely optimistic estimates are more likely to arise: for <em>k</em>&nbsp;= 30, the disappointment will be around twice the standard deviation in the estimates.<sup>4</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/optimizers-curse.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This is \"the optimizer's curse.\" See Smith &amp; Winkler (2006) for the proof.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"The_Solution\">The Solution</h4>\n<p>The solution to the optimizer's curse is rather straightforward.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...[we] model the uncertainty in&nbsp;the value estimates explicitly and use Bayesian methods&nbsp;to interpret these value estimates.&nbsp;Specifically, we&nbsp;assign a prior distribution on the vector of true values&nbsp;\u03bc = (\u03bc<sub>1</sub>, ...,&nbsp;\u03bc<sub>n</sub>) and&nbsp;describe the accuracy of the&nbsp;value estimates V = (V<sub>1</sub>, ..., V<sub>n</sub>) by a conditional&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;V|\u03bc\u0001\u0001. Then, rather than ranking alternatives.&nbsp;based on the value estimates, after we have done the&nbsp;decision analysis and observed the value estimates V,&nbsp;we use Bayes\u2019 rule to determine the posterior distribution&nbsp;for \u0001\u0001\u03bc|V and rank and choose among alternatives&nbsp;based on the posterior means...</p>\n<p>The key to overcoming the optimizer\u2019s curse is conceptually&nbsp;very simple: treat the results of the analysis&nbsp;as uncertain and combine these results with prior&nbsp;estimates of value using Bayes\u2019 rule before choosing&nbsp;an alternative. This process formally recognizes&nbsp;the uncertainty in value estimates and corrects for&nbsp;the bias that is built into the optimization process by&nbsp;adjusting high estimated values downward. To adjust&nbsp;values properly, we need to understand the degree&nbsp;of uncertainty in these estimates and in the true values..<sup>5</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To return to our original question: <em>Yes</em>, some skepticism is justified when considering the option before you with the highest expected value. To minimize your prediction error, treat the results of your decision analysis as uncertain and use Bayes' Theorem to combine its results with an appropriate prior.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Notes\">Notes</h4>\n<p><small><sup>1</sup> Smith &amp; Winkler (2006).</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>2</sup> Lindley et al.

He deteriorated markedly as he approached death.

My wife, Genie, and my three daughters help me a lot, with food, walks, talks, and gifts. I usually feel good. Many other people say and do nice things for me.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Life began as cells 3 &frac12; billion years ago and gradually spread out from one species to another. There is no evidence of any species living after death. Therefore, each human should enjoy life, itself. Long before our Earth formed, our Universe spread out 14 billion years ago, long after material existed, which may have been forever. On that basis, I think human lives are a result of amazing development. We can enjoy life deeply into old age and on almost to death. No human should weaken true enjoyment by physically attacking another human. A human may argue with another human with the purpose of keeping both lives enjoyable.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When approaching death, a person should overcome huge pain by mental concentration or medicine and enjoy the remainder of life. This can be done by listening to music, relatives, friends, reading, and other actions. Life can be pleasant to the end, or about to the end. Enjoy yourself. Be nice to others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The unedited entry (still up, along with other postings to his blog) concerns the mental topics that were occupying him at the end of life: mainly birdwatching and overpopulation. I post it here as evidence that even a very old person, suffering the mental and physical burdens of advanced old age, can still enjoy themselves and value life.</p>\n<p>From one perspective, it is the ramblings of an old man succumbing to dementia.

specifically relevant to you and your security pass.<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>But you are not rational, and your brain is lazy; and as soon as you phrase your question and pass it on to your subconscious, your brain just Googles itself with a query like</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">why people forget things</p>\n<p>looks at the first few hits it comes across, maybe finds their

We're not entirely sure what&nbsp;its motivations are, but we would prefer that the AI cooperate with humanity;&nbsp;or, failing that, that we can destroy it before it defects. We'll have someone&nbsp;sitting in a room, their finger on a detonator, ready at the slightest hint of&nbsp;defection.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately as has been noted... this does not preclude the AI from&nbsp;misbehaving. It just means that the AI must act to take control of the explosives,&nbsp;the detonators or the human who will press the button. For a superlatively&nbsp;intelligence AI, this would represent merely a slight extra difficulty.&nbsp;But now imagine that the AI was somehow indifferent to the explosives going&nbsp;off or not (but that nothing else was changed). Then if ever the AI does decide&nbsp;to defect, it will most likely do so without taking control of the explosives, as&nbsp;that would be easier than otherwise. By \"easier\" we mean that the chances of&nbsp;failure are less, since the plan is simpler... recall that under these assumptions,&nbsp;the AI counts getting blown up as an equal value to successfully defecting.&nbsp;How could we accomplish this indifference?</p>\n</blockquote>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false,

\"strawberries\"; if I mention a complicated dish once then I'll shorten it when I eat the leftovers, as \"pasta\" for \"pasta with artichokes and spinach and pesto\"; times given approximately and not in a consistent form and often without specifying if they're a.m. or p.m., though they are in chronological order).&nbsp; Quantities aren't given, although if they're suspected to be relevant I may be able to remember specific instances (for unusual foods) or typical portions (for ordinary foods) - other details might also be recollectable similarly.&nbsp; I also don't notice when headaches go away, so I don't know how long they last except when they last all day or become noticeably worse during their course.&nbsp; My sleep schedule varied considerably over this period, but trends more night owl than early bird (for a while I was outright nocturnal).&nbsp; I moved three time zones west at the end of July, should that matter at all.</p>\n<p>I'm not soliciting commentary on my diet except insofar as it can be compellingly related to my headaches.</p>\n<p>ETA: Assume that every single day I'm drinking lots of skim milk.&nbsp; (2-6 cups depending on how much I eat and how it's spaced out.)&nbsp; There's a couple of exceptions, mostly when I'm in transit for most of a day or run out of milk, but not many and they don't seem to correlate with headaches.</p>",

have an irrational bias in favor of living where they're used to- therefore, it is at least worth considering moving somewhere else as the intuitive cost-benefit ratio (if it can even be called that) is likely scewed.\r\n<div>\r\n<p>My general knowledge and geography is, however, rather poor. There are a few things I want to know about- some general questions, and some things that require at least some rationality to assess.</p>\r\n<p>What I want to avoid:</p>\r\n<p>-Internet censorship</p>\r\n<p>-Laws restricting my ability to 'go about my buisness' (e.g laws in Europe involving intervening in a crisis)</p>\r\n<p>-Weak economies</p>\r\n<p>-Weak property rights (I'd count everywhere where it's illegal to kill a burgular robbing my home- weak meaning weak relative to what I want, admittedly)</p>\r\n<p>-Places of poor employment for whatever profession I go (most likely lawyers).</p>\r\n<p>It's easy to work out where those are the case now- but gaining a decent model of where a country that's nice to live in may exist in the future (i.e no censorship, strong economy, good employment and wages, little interference in my life) is very, very difficult even in the best case scenario. Furthurmore, it's almost certain I can't secure them all.</p>\r\n<p>Does anybody know of any countries where it is likely that over the next two decades or so these standards are at least likely to be well met? I know it's unlikely, but the expected value of posting this is positive and I place a high enough value on finding out that I'm giving it a try.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Persons with High Functioning Autism\":<br /></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the proposal that individual differences in belief will reflect cognitive processing styles, with high functioning autism being an extreme style that will predispose towards nonbelief (atheism and agnosticism). This view was supported by content analysis of discussion forums about religion on an autism website (covering 192 unique posters), and by a survey that included 61 persons with HFA. Persons with autistic spectrum disorder were much more likely than those in our neurotypical comparison group to identify as atheist or agnostic, and, if religious, were more likely to construct their own religious belief system. Nonbelief was also higher in those who were attracted to systemizing activities, as measured by the Systemizing Quotient.</p>\n<p>...Personality psychologists have identified two styles of reasoning: emphasis on logic and emphasis on intuition (Demaria, Kassinove &amp; Dill 1989). As the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) thinking traits are indicative of a logical cognitive style, we developed a set of thinking traits that would be represented in postings by neurotypical (NT) individuals.<br />The NT thinking traits embody the complimentary attributes of the ASD thinking traits. For example the NT thinking trait \"emphasis on intuition\" was developed to compliment the ASD thinking trait \"emphasis on logic\". The NT thinking traits looked for in the postings were emphasis on intuition, oriented towards social rewards, empathizing, symbolic fluidity/gestalt thinking, and openness to experience.<br />...[discussion forum analysis:] Religious beliefs were found to differ significantly between the HFA and NT populations, &chi;2 (12, N=387)= 43.69, p &lt; .01. As shown in Figure 1, individuals with HFA were less likely to belong to an organized religion than their NT counterparts and were more likely to create their own religious belief system. The \"own-construction\" category comprised 16% of the HFA population as compared to only 6% of the NT population. HFA individuals also demonstrated higher rates of non-belief identities such as Atheism (26%) and Agnosticism (17%). In the NT group, only 17% of the population were Atheists and 10% were Agnostic.<br />...[survey:] Religious beliefs were found to differ significantly between the HFA and NT populations, __ (12, N= 166) = 22.698, p &lt; .01. As was found in the content analysis of discussion forums, HFA questionnaire respondents were less likely than their NT counterparts to belong to an organized religion. HFA individuals were more likely to be atheist than were NT individuals. The \"own construction\" belief category was also found to be proportionally greater in the HFA population than in the NT population (see Figure 3).<br />...[from conclusion]: We suggest that individual differences in cognitive styles is an important predictor of human belief systems, including religious belief. An extreme type of cognitive style is high functioning autism. The 2 studies reported here found that individuals with HFA have a higher rate than neurotypicals of endorsing atheism and agnosticism. HFA individuals thus resemble another group of high-systemizers (scientists), who also reject religious belief at a relatively high rate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Caldwell-Harris et al

art?</p>\n<p>It's an interesting question, but it seems that most people who answer that question in the affirmative are--intentionally or not--subscribing to the \"hybrid art\" view.&nbsp; That is, that games are art because they combine story-telling, music, and visual style; interaction with the system of the game is <em>in service </em>to the storyline, music, and visual style.</p>\n<p>I don't like that.&nbsp; Here is why:</p>\n<p>\"Art\" in general is <em>creative expression through a medium. </em>The hybrid-art view treats gameplay as the icing on the narrative-musical-visual cake.&nbsp; When it should be that gameplay is the cake, and everything else is the icing.</p>\n<p>Gameplay, or interaction with the system of the game, is a&nbsp; medium for artistic expression, just like paint is for paintings.&nbsp; I don't think anyone can deny that interaction with a gun during a hostile situation reeks havoc on our emotions, or that interaction with a loved one can run the emotional gamut.&nbsp; Interaction is powerful.</p>\n<p>Games can take advantage of the power of interaction to be expressive.&nbsp; The art of the storyline, music, and visuals ought to be secondary to the art of the gameplay.</p>\n<p><strong>Twelve Virtues</strong></p>\n<p>I believe that gameplay is a very powerful way to learn, and so the single most important design principle for our current project is <em>expression through gameplay</em>.&nbsp; We want to convey the meaning of each virtue through gameplay<strong>. </strong>The player should be able examine the method by which they interact with the game to learn the meaning behind the virtue.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://shinyogre.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Frame_2_gameplay_art.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-223\" title=\"Curiosity\" src=\"http://shinyogre.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Frame_2_gameplay_art-500x375.png\" alt=\"Point of no return\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p>In our Curiosity level which is where the game starts, the player must follow a mysterious cat that appears.&nbsp; Very early in the level, the player is faced with a \"point of no return\".&nbsp; If they jump down to the ground, they can't ever go back to the starting area.&nbsp; They must choose to follow the cat, or stay in their \"comfort zone\" so to speak.&nbsp; They must embrace their curiosity, or ignore it.&nbsp; If they choose to follow the cat, they will eventually discover a much larger area full of mysteries to be solved.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

The approach provides a unified rationale for data analysis, which both justifies many of the commonly used analysis procedures and reveals some of the implicit underlying assumptions. This review summarizes the general ideas of the Bayesian probability theory with emphasis on the application to the evaluation of experimental data. As case studies for Bayesian parameter estimation techniques examples ranging from extra-solar planet detection to the deconvolution of the apparatus functions for improving the energy resolution and change point estimation in time series are discussed. Special attention is paid to the numerical techniques suited for Bayesian analysis, with a focus on recent developments of Markov chain Monte&nbsp;Carlo algorithms for high-dimensional integration problems. Bayesian model comparison, the quantitative ranking of models for the explanation of a given data set, is illustrated with examples collected from cosmology, mass spectroscopy, and surface physics, covering problems such as background subtraction and automated outlier detection. Additionally the Bayesian inference techniques for the design and optimization of future experiments are introduced. Experiments, instead of being merely passive recording devices, can now be designed to adapt to measured data and to change the measurement strategy on the fly to maximize the information of an experiment. The applied key concepts and necessary numerical tools which provide the means of designing such inference chains and the crucial aspects of data fusion are summarized and some of the expected implications are highlighted.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rights\" style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;\">\n<p style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.8em; padding-left: 15px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 0.75em; color: #323232; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;\">&copy; 2011 American Physical Society</p>\n</div>\n</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": null, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "vwScwDWfpPLAsM9Pp", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 7, "baseScore": 9, "extendedScore": null, "score": 7.719707565781056e-07, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "9969", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 6, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": {"html": "<p>A nice article just appeared in Reviews of Modern Physics.

Experiments, instead of being merely passive recording devices, can now be designed to adapt to measured data and to change the measurement strategy on the fly to maximize the information of an experiment. The applied key concepts and necessary numerical tools which provide the means of designing such inference chains and the crucial aspects of data fusion are summarized and some of the expected implications are highlighted.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rights\" style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;\">\n<p style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.8em; padding-left: 15px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 0.75em; color: #323232; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;\">\u00a9 2011 American Physical Society</p>\n</div>\n</span><p></p>\n</blockquote>", "sections": [{"title": "Rev.

I am now ready to subject the world to my terrible programming skills.</p>\n<p>I suspect most computer users will be familiar with the game of minesweeper - it really isn't all that complex by itself. However, I've added a little twist to it. The idea is the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mines and people are randomly distributed across the minefield.</li>\n<li>The player can only detect mines, not people.</li>\n<li>The player can stop searching for mines at any time she/he desires.</li>\n<li>If the player opens a cell with a mine, all mines detonate.</li>\n<li>If the player stops searching, only the non-flagged mines detonate.</li>\n<li>Once the game ends, every person in an explosion or next to one dies.</li>\n<li>Every survivor contributes 10 pleasure.</li>\n<li>Every death contributes 10 pain.</li>\n<li>For every death, every survivor contributes 0.05 pain.</li>\n<li>There are 480 cells, 250 people and 99 mines.</li>\n<li>Your goal, should you choose to embrace it, is to maximise the pleasure/pain ratio.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That is all. The values I chose arbitrarily, but right now I feel it's pretty balanced. Once you flag around a third of the mines, the ratio starts rising considerably, but there is always an element of chance. If you hit a mine on your first try (or quit immediately), around 80% of the people will die on average.</p>\n<p>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Python 2.7, ncurses.</p>\n<p>Update #1: Implemented JushuaZ's idea - if you flag an empty cell, all your flags are disregarded.</p>\n<p>Update #2: Fixed bug spotted by DanielLC</p>\n<p><a title=\"Bayesian Minesweeper\" href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/file/k7p00iz6t67y8p4/bsweep.py\">Bayesian Minesweeper</a></p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "RFkoYjQWu2kd2Qa5y", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 7, "baseScore": 4, "extendedScore": null, "score": 7.719899541295219e-07, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "9970", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 2, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": null, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 21, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-09-20T02:09:49.470Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "Can't Pursue the Art for its Own Sake?

EY say's this in The Twelve Virtues and in Something to Protect, but I don't know what his argument is. He goes as far as to say that you must subordinate rationality to a higher value.</p>\n<p>I understand that by committing yourself to <em>your</em> <em>rationality</em> you lose out on the chance to notice if your conception of rationality is wrong. But what if I use the reliability of win that a given conception of rationality offers me as the only guide to how correct that conception is. I can test reliability of win by taking a bunch of different problems with known answers that I don't know, solving them using my current conception of rationality and solving them using the alternative conception of rationality I want to test, then checking the answers I arrived at with each conception against the right answers. I could also take a bunch of unsolved problems and attack them from both conceptions of rationality, and see which one I get the most solutions with. If I solve a set of problems with one, that isn't a subset of the set of problems I solved with the other, then I'll see if I can somehow take the <em>union</em> of the two conceptions. And, though I'm still not sure enough about this method to use it, I suppose I could also figure out the relative reliability of two conceptions by making general arguments about the structures of those conceptions; if one conception is \"do that which the great teacher says\" and the other is \"do that which has maximal expected utility\", I would probably not have to solve problems using both conceptions to see which one most reliably leads to win.</p>\n<p>And what if my goal is to become as epistimically rational as possible. Then I would just be looking for the conception of rationality that leads to truth most reliably. Testing truth by predictive power.</p>\n<p>And if being rational for its own sake just doesn't seem like its valuable enough to motivate me to do all the hard work it requires, let's assume that I really really care about picking the best conception of rationality I know of, much more than I care about my own life.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that if this is how I do rationality for its own sake &mdash; always looking for the conception of goal-oriented rationality which leads to win most reliably, and the conception of epistemic rationality which leads to truth most reliably &mdash; then I'll always switch to any conception I find that is less mistaken than mine, and stick with mine when presented with a conception that is more mistaken, provided I am careful enough about my testing. And if that means I practice rationality for its own sake, so what? I practice music for its own sake too. I don't think that's the only or best reason to pursue rationality, certainly some other good and common reasons are if you wanna figure something out or win. And when I do eventually find something I wanna win or figure out that no one else has (no shortage of those), if I can't, I'll know that my current conception isn't good enough. I'll be able to correct my conception by winning or figuring it out, and then thinking about what was missing from my view of rationality that wouldn't let me do that before. But that wouldn't mean that I care more about winning or figuring some special fact than I do about being as rational as possible; it would just mean that I consider my ability to solve problems a judge of my rationality.</p>\n<p>I don't understand what I loose out on if I pursue the Art for its own sake in the way described above. If you do know of something I would loose out on, or if you know Yudkowsky's original argument showing the infinite recursion when you motivate yourself to be rational by your love of rationality,

A summary (taken from the <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong/2007_Articles/Summaries\">LW wiki</a>):</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>Traditional Rationality is phrased in terms of social rules, with violations interpretable as cheating - as defections from cooperative norms. But viewing rationality as a social obligation gives rise to some strange ideas. The laws of rationality are mathematics, and no social manoeuvring can exempt you.</blockquote>\n<p><br />Discuss the post here (rather than in the comments to the original post).<br /><br /><em>This post is part of the Rerunning the Sequences series, where we'll be going through Eliezer Yudkowsky's old posts in order so that people who are interested can (re-)read and discuss them.

in high school, describes the moment in college when a professor talked about listing a child's behaviors and letting a listener draw their own conclusions, rather than just calling the child bad-- this level of empiricism was a revelation to Harris and permanently changed the way he thought. This starts about 3 minutes into the recording and only runs for about five minutes.</p>\n<p>His general point is that a lot of the gap between black and white students can be explained by teachers giving up on the black students-- he's got studies-- and that a lot of what looks like oppositional behavior is actually frustration from students who are being expected to learn things that they weren't given the prior education to understand.</p>\n<p>I'd say his more general point is to have more respect for the idea that people are showing ordinary human reactions to their situations rather

Ramachandran has recently made some of the points in a <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/23/tell-tale-brain-exchange/\">polite sparring</a> with philosopher Colin McGinn over Ramachandran's new book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tell-Tale-Brain-Neuroscientists-Quest-Makes/dp/0393077829/\">The Tell-Tale Brain</a></em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Early in any scientific enterprise, it is best to forge ahead and not get bogged down by semantic distinctions. But &ldquo;forging ahead&rdquo; is a concept alien to philosophers, even those as distinguished as McGinn. To a philosopher who demanded that he define consciousness before studying it scientifically, Francis Crick once responded, &ldquo;My dear chap, there was never a time in the early years of molecular biology when we sat around the table with a bunch of philosophers saying &lsquo;let us define life first.&rsquo; We just went out there and found out what it was: a double helix.&rdquo; In the

together.&nbsp; Looking at the pieces, looking at the picture of the assembled figure, we made observations about what constraints we saw, what piece on the table might correspond to something in the picture, convinced whoever was holding the piece in question to put it in a particular place, and gradually assembled the puzzle cooperatively.&nbsp; We had an instruction sheet with pictures of the puzzle at 3 different stages of completion.&nbsp; It took us something under 10 minutes.&nbsp; (Several of those were taken up mutually deciding in which order to follow the pictures, as one person had started using the picture showing the first stage, one had started with the picture showing the last stage and was disassembling the semi-assembled first stage for parts, and one had no clear strategy.)</p>\n<p>A few hours later, after the game ended, I sat at the table with the disassembled puzzle pieces, and put it together by myself, following the pictures from first stage to last.&nbsp; I was not aware of any memories of how it had been assembled the last time; and anyway, the instruction sheet was much more valuable than any memories I had.&nbsp; (It wasn't one of those symmetric 3D puzzles where there's a pattern or trick to it; it was a collection of oddly-shaped unique pieces assembled in three layers.)&nbsp; It took less than a minute.</p>", "submitToFrontpage":

So basically you can't prove that anyone exists unless they're directly in front of you.</p>\r\n<p>I'm really not certain how to go about answering this question. I mean, he challenged me to prove that my mother existed, without seeing her. Obviously I couldn't.</p>\r\n<p>Is he right? Or is there some flaw in his argument, some fallacy that I'm missing?</p>\r\n<p>I went through a few of the Sequences, and the closest article I could find was about not believing in the invisible. But in this case, he doesn't literally (I think) believe they just vanish, he believes they enter alternate universes that are selected when I come in contact them again.</p>\r\n<p>My mind is boggled.

I was at the cottage with my family, exercising moderately (about 2 kilometers of swimming daily) and eating my mom's excellent-tasting cooking. After about one and a half weeks, I had lost 5 pounds, although I suspect a lot of it was water retention/bloating, since I had been eating wheat and various junk foods all summer.</p>\r\n<p>Then school started, and with it my 16-hour days away from home, including one marathon session where I leave my parents' house at 5:00 am on Monday morning, sleep at a friend's house,&nbsp;and don't come back again until 11 pm on Tuesday, only to work 5:30 am to 4 pm at the pool the next day.</p>\r\n<p>In short: my diet is quickly deteriorating and I have regained those 5 pounds. I find it next to&nbsp;impossible to stay gluten-free, since I have to be incredibly organized and pack everything from home, and inevitably it isn't quite enough for 16 hours.&nbsp;(I eat 3000 calories a day or more when not dieting. According to a metabolism study I participated in last year, this is actually how much I burn per day with the amount of exercise I get. If I eat much less, say less than 2000 for one day or less than 2,500 for several&nbsp;consecutive days,&nbsp;I get dizzy and weak&nbsp;when I exercise, which is really irritating.) I would probably be able to lose weight more easily if I exercised LESS, but this would a) kind of defeat the point, and b) be difficult because exercise is my main stress control method.</p>\r\n<p>Willpower is a big issue, which is weird and annoying because usually it's <em>not </em>a big issue for me. Especially when I'm sleep deprived (nearly all the time), stressed, or bored to tears in my classes, I tend to comfort or reward myself with food, and nearly all my 'comfort foods' have wheat in them. I can resist to a degree if I have access to other reward/comforts, like sleep, or lots and lots of tea.</p>\r\n<p>I've never really had to learn any willpower tricks for dieting, since I usually let my weight sit at its natural set-point.

You could have figured out most of what's in The Sequences yourself by reading lots of cognitive science and the best of physics and philosophy, but that would have required many years and highly developed rationality skills.</p>\n<p>But, having some indication of their value, would you have <em>paid</em> to read The Sequences, if that was the only way? I hope you can see that would have been a good choice.</p>\n<p>If you want to be a scholar, learn how to get knowledge for free. But if you can't find a high-value source of knowledge for free, don't give up just because you've been trained to expect that knowledge should be free. Remember that knowledge is worth paying for.</p>\n<p>Let me finish with three tips for efficient knowledge purchasing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Get Thee to a Library</h4>\n<p>There is no efficient way for an individual scholar to pay for access to journal article databases like JSTOR, ScienceDirect, Springer, or Wiley. But, you <em>can</em> go to the library of a major research university, sit down in their computer lab, and download hundreds of papers from behind paywalls onto your flash drive (or upload them to your <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a> account).</p>\n<p>In L.A., I kept a list of the papers I needed to download in Google docs and drove 40 minutes each way to the UCLA library once every two weeks. That costs time and money (for gas), but it was <em>much</em>&nbsp;cheaper than buying individual subscriptions to all those databases.</p>\n<p>I also paid $100/yr for a non-student UCLA library card so I could check out books from the university, which had a much better selection of academic books (and a better interlibrary loan system) than the L.A. public library system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>$10 Textbook Rentals</h4>\n<p>Often, I need to read a few chapters from a very expensive textbook or academic book, but I can't find those chapters available anywhere online. Usually, recently released textbooks aren't available at my local libraries, either.</p>\n<p>However, I have discovered a way to <em>rent</em>&nbsp;textbooks through the mail for only $15 each. (This is another secret of efficient scholarship: Get in the habit of feeling good about <em>paying for efficiently compressed knowledge</em>&nbsp;when you need to.)</p>\n<p>Here's how it works. Textbook rental website Chegg.com has a 21-day 'any reason' return policy. Rent a book, read the sections you need to read (or photograph them for yourself) right away when it arrives, then return it. You end up paying only shipping and sales tax, which on a $120 book ends up costing between $10 and $15.</p>\n<p>I've done this several times now, and it has worked every time:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Handbook-Neuroethics-Library-Psychology/dp/0199570701/\">Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics</a></em> (OUP, 2011)<br />Amazon price: $150.77<br />Total Chegg cost after refund: $14.99</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Handbook-Causation-Handbooks/dp/019927973X/\">Oxford Handbook of Causation</a></em> (OUP, 2010)<br />Amazon price: #117.33<br />Total Chegg cost after refund: $9.99</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Intimate-Relationships-Thomas-N-Bradbury/dp/0393979571/\">Intimate Relationships</a></em> (W.W.

I usually find the lowest prices at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/kindle-store-ebooks-newspapers-blogs/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=133141011\">Amazon Kindle</a> or <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ebooks\">Google ebookstore</a>, so those are my two default sources. Of course, you don't need a mobile&nbsp;device&nbsp;to read books purchased from either store.</p>\n<p>A sampling of my recent ebook purchases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Intuition-Michael-R-DePaul/dp/0847687953/\">Rethinking Intuition</a></em>&nbsp;(Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999)<br />Google ebookstore:&nbsp;$37.09<br />Hardcopy on Amazon:&nbsp;$119</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Handbook-Intelligence-Handbooks-Psychology/dp/052173911X/\">Cambridge Handbook of Intelligence</a></em>&nbsp;(CUP, 2011)<br />Kindle:&nbsp;$48<br />Hardcopy on Amazon:&nbsp;$68.49</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Enhancing-Human-Capacities-Julian-Savulescu/dp/1405195819/\">Enhancing Human Capacities</a></em>&nbsp;(Wiley-Blackwell, 2011)<br />Kindle:&nbsp;$49.49<br />Hardcopy on Amazon:&nbsp;$74.73</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Heuristics-Biases-Psychology-Intuitive-Judgment/dp/0521796792/\">Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment</a></em>&nbsp;(CUP, 2002)<br />Kindle:&nbsp;$37.12<br />Hardcopy on Amazon:&nbsp;$46.52</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, sometimes a book is worth buying even if it's not available online, at a local library, via Chegg.com, or as an ebook. I recently bought <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rationality-Reflective-Mind-Keith-Stanovich/dp/0195341147/\">Rationality and the Reflective Mind</a></em>&nbsp;(2010) as a good ol' fashioned hunk of paper.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Lots of people ask me how my articles can be so scholarly. One reason is that I've learned <a href=\"/lw/5me/scholarship_how_to_do_it_efficiently/\">how to do scholarship efficiently</a>. Another reason is that I've learned that knowledge is worth paying for.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false,

That costs time and money (for gas), but it was <em>much</em>&nbsp;cheaper than buying individual subscriptions to all those databases.</p>\n<p>I also paid $100/yr for a non-student UCLA library card so I could check out books from the university, which had a much better selection of academic books (and a better interlibrary loan system) than the L.A. public library system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"_10_Textbook_Rentals\">$10 Textbook Rentals</h4>\n<p>Often, I need to read a few chapters from a very expensive textbook or academic book, but I can't find those chapters available anywhere online. Usually, recently released textbooks aren't available at my local libraries, either.</p>\n<p>However, I have discovered a way to <em>rent</em>&nbsp;textbooks through the mail for only $15 each. (This is another secret of efficient scholarship: Get in the habit of feeling good about <em>paying for efficiently compressed knowledge</em>&nbsp;when you need to.)</p>\n<p>Here's how it works. Textbook rental website Chegg.com has a 21-day 'any reason' return policy. Rent a book, read the sections you need to read (or photograph them for yourself) right away when it arrives, then return it. You end up paying only shipping and sales tax, which on a $120 book ends up costing between $10 and $15.</p>\n<p>I've done this several times now, and it has worked every time:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Handbook-Neuroethics-Library-Psychology/dp/0199570701/\">Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics</a></em> (OUP, 2011)<br>Amazon price: $150.77<br>Total Chegg cost after refund: $14.99</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Handbook-Causation-Handbooks/dp/019927973X/\">Oxford Handbook of Causation</a></em> (OUP, 2010)<br>Amazon price: #117.33<br>Total Chegg cost after refund: $9.99</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Intimate-Relationships-Thomas-N-Bradbury/dp/0393979571/\">Intimate Relationships</a></em> (W.W.

I usually find the lowest prices at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/kindle-store-ebooks-newspapers-blogs/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=133141011\">Amazon Kindle</a> or <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ebooks\">Google ebookstore</a>, so those are my two default sources. Of course, you don't need a mobile&nbsp;device&nbsp;to read books purchased from either store.</p>\n<p>A sampling of my recent ebook purchases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Intuition-Michael-R-DePaul/dp/0847687953/\">Rethinking Intuition</a></em>&nbsp;(Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999)<br>Google ebookstore:&nbsp;$37.09<br>Hardcopy on Amazon:&nbsp;$119</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Handbook-Intelligence-Handbooks-Psychology/dp/052173911X/\">Cambridge Handbook of Intelligence</a></em>&nbsp;(CUP, 2011)<br>Kindle:&nbsp;$48<br>Hardcopy on Amazon:&nbsp;$68.49</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Enhancing-Human-Capacities-Julian-Savulescu/dp/1405195819/\">Enhancing Human Capacities</a></em>&nbsp;(Wiley-Blackwell, 2011)<br>Kindle:&nbsp;$49.49<br>Hardcopy on Amazon:&nbsp;$74.73</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Heuristics-Biases-Psychology-Intuitive-Judgment/dp/0521796792/\">Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment</a></em>&nbsp;(CUP, 2002)<br>Kindle:&nbsp;$37.12<br>Hardcopy on Amazon:&nbsp;$46.52</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, sometimes a book is worth buying even if it's not available online, at a local library, via Chegg.com, or as an ebook. I recently bought <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rationality-Reflective-Mind-Keith-Stanovich/dp/0195341147/\">Rationality and the Reflective Mind</a></em>&nbsp;(2010) as a good ol' fashioned hunk of paper.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Lots of people ask me how my articles can be so scholarly. One reason is that I've learned <a href=\"/lw/5me/scholarship_how_to_do_it_efficiently/\">how to do scholarship efficiently</a>. Another reason is that I've learned that knowledge is worth paying for.</p>", "sections": [{"title": "Get Thee to a Library", "anchor": "Get_Thee_to_a_Library", "level": 1}, {"title": "$10 Textbook

When you are primed with a concept, the facts related to that concept come to mind easier. As a result, the data set selected by your mind becomes tilted towards the elements related to that concept, even if it has no relation to the question you are trying to answer. Your thinking becomes contaminated, shifted in a particular direction. The data set in your focus of attention becomes less representative of the phenomenon you are trying to model, and more representative of the concepts you were primed with.</blockquote>\n<p><br />Discuss the post here (rather than in the comments to the original post).<br /><br /><em>This post is part of the Rerunning the Sequences series, where we'll be going through Eliezer Yudkowsky's old posts in order so that people who are interested can (re-)read and discuss them.

href=\"/r/discussion/lw/7d1/scientifically_optimizing_education_hard_problem/\">recent post</a> brought up the topic of optimizing education. One particular approach, Direct Instruction (Misha&rsquo;s <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/7g3/what_direct_instruction_is/\">better explanation</a>), claims to have essentially solved the problem. In particular, Direct Instruction (DI) does allegedly not only work for basic reading skills, but any teaching task. Owen brought up the Michel Thomas language courses as a good application. Language learning is one of my main interests, so I gave the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Michel-Thomas-Foundation-Course-French/dp/0340938919/\">French Foundation</a> course a try.</p>\n<p>The main point of the review is to summarize what Michel Thomas actually <em>does</em>, how it <em>differs</em> from other common paradigms and how <em>effective</em> it seems to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Nice for beginners and people with bad learning experiences; limited use afterwards. The audio-only aspect is very convenient. It complements other strategies well and I see it as a good proof-of-concept of DI-like methods for language learning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a disclaimer. Michel Thomas (MT) is not officially a DI course and as far as I could google, Thomas propbably wasn&rsquo;t aware of DI at all. However, according to Solity's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Michel-Thomas-Jonathan-Solity/dp/0340928336\">The Language Revolution</a> and Owen, the reason MT works so well is that it applies (an approximation of) DI techniques. It is right now the best realistic example beyond the grade school level, so it&rsquo;ll have to do.</p>\n<p>I had some French in high school and thanks to fluency in German and English, I can read some French, but I have no active skill at all, nor have I ever used French in a serious way.</p>\n<p>I have now completed the first half of the French Foundation course and skimmed many other courses. You can listen to the first <a href=\"http://www.audible.co.uk/pd?asin=B004GYSQZC\">20 minutes here</a>; they are very representative. Furthermore you can read the <a href=\"http://www.michelthomas.com/downloads.php\">booklets</a> to get an idea of the material covered in each course. The whole course is audio-only, consists of 8 CDs (and 2 review CDs) and is intended to be listened to only once.<sup id=\"fnref:once\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn:once\">1</a></sup> There are several advanced courses which merely cover more grammar points and vocabulary. Structurally, they are all the same.</p>\n<h2 id=\"method\">Method</h2>\n<p>MT teaches the course to two new students<sup id=\"fnref:students\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn:students\">2</a></sup>. You&rsquo;re supposed to take the role of a third student, pausing the recording whenever MT asks a question so that you can say your own answer. One of the two students also answers and you can compare your reply and listen to MT&rsquo;s advice and error correction. Both students are beginners, so most of your mistakes will be covered that way.</p>\n<p>MT introduces one language component at a time and makes you use it in a given sentence. He provides a short explanation first and then lets the students answer a couple of examples by giving them an English sentence and asking them to translate it into French. Each component is thus reinforced through many examples.</p>\n<p>MT also tries to combine the translation tasks over time by re-using partial sentences. This way, sentence quickly look complex, but always stay easy. (&ldquo;What impression do you have of the political and economical situation in France at the present time?&rdquo; is used about one hour in!)</p>\n<p>Vocabulary is only introduced as necessary and relies heavily on cognates. The primary focus is on teaching structure. MT strongly emphasizes not to guess or try to remember anything, but instead to rely on induction (&ldquo;Do not guess, but think it out!&rdquo;). This works because the examples are carefully chosen to be as obvious as possible. All translation tasks have only one correct answer. All production is tightly controlled. MT relies on the constant tests to see that the students are successfully keeping up. He is never unsure if some concept has been understood or not.</p>\n<p>Complex rules that might thematically belong together (like verb conjugations) are broken apart so that each individual new form or word is learned on its own. Similar rules that might be confused are deliberately spread out.</p>\n<p>MT stresses that you aren&rsquo;t supposed to try to remember anything. If you don&rsquo;t know something, then <em>he</em> has not succeeded as a teacher yet and he will take care of it, not you. He does this by doing manual <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition\">spaced repetition</a>, i.e. he repeats previous questions (or similar ones) over time and tests the students constantly. If they have trouble answering, then he quickly goes back to the relevant lesson. This is of course how most language textbooks are supposed to be used, but they rely entirely on the student doing the testing themselves. Instead, MT provides the complete lesson including all necessary repetitions so the student doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything at all except answer MT&rsquo;s constant stream of translation tasks. (As a programmer, I&rsquo;m strongly reminded of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unwinding\">loop unrolling</a>.)</p>\n<p>What I stood out for me was the reward structure. Students rarely make big mistakes and actual correction is mostly needed for pronunciation issues. The major way students do fail is by simply not remembering something, which MT easily fixes by reminding them again. The students have good confidence in their answers and don&rsquo;t have to guess. The lessons are fast-paced and consist mostly of tests. MT is constantly positively reinforcing the students, rarely correcting them. The whole lesson looks a lot more like an Anki session than a class room or a traditional textbook.</p>\n<h2 id=\"comparison-to-other-methods\">Comparison to other methods</h2>\n<p>The course is basically a (minimally edited) live class MT teaches. The result is a very natural pacing. This has the major advantage that it never goes too fast. Most other courses edit out mistakes or necessary repetitions out of fear they might be too boring, but by doing so, no student can actually keep up. This can&rsquo;t happen with MT&rsquo;s untrained live students. (Unfortunately, MT&rsquo;s courses are also unscripted, so he does make a few organizational mistakes and the later courses don&rsquo;t exactly fit together. Fortunately this is not a big issue due to MT&rsquo;s large experience.)</p>\n<p>A major difference to most other approaches is that MT actively implements what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen\">Krashen</a> calls &ldquo;i+1&rdquo;, where i is the current level of a learner, meaning that concepts are taught in the order of minimal effort. Each new step contains exactly one new rule. Most language courses group rules according to some underlying pattern, like tenses, and expect you to learn a whole group at once.</p>\n<p>MT focuses entirely on production, both by using only translation tasks and by teaching only useful components, i.e. parts of the language you need for a wide variety of contexts. No lesson has only one narrow use. This creates a very active learning experience. I fully agree with this early focus on grammar (but not grammar theory!). Once you&rsquo;re done with that, you can go more-or-less monolingual and immerse yourself in the target language, relying on spaced repetition software to rapidly build your vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, MT&rsquo;s course is very engaging. There is little downtime where you merely listen. It consists almost exclusively of quick tests. Thanks to i+1, you never have to juggle more than one new rule at a time. The subject matter does not get repetitive and MT is a very enthusiastic teacher. This can be a major problem with other language courses.</p>\n<p>My main criticism, especially as an autodidact, would be that MT never makes his methods explicit. You entirely rely on him. He may have an awesome lesson plan, but you&rsquo;re never taught how he arrived at it or how to continue beyond that.<sup id=\"fnref:method\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn:method\">3</a></sup> Hopefully that&rsquo;s not a general problem with DI. In particular, any language course should teach you how to use <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition\">spaced repetition</a>. It&rsquo;s the only sane way to handle vocabulary and prevent unnecessary review sessions.<sup id=\"fnref:anki\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn:anki\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>For contrast, look at the (excellent) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji\">Remembering The Kanji</a>, which similarly teaches Japanese characters through decomposition, logical ordering and the use of mnemonics. However, much of the book focuses on teaching the <em>method</em> and the logic behind it, so that you can use it for any amount of characters you want. It is very simple to move beyond the scope of the book. I wish every textbook worked like this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m quite impressed by the course design. It&rsquo;s really effective at building a solid speaking foundation. It won&rsquo;t get you anywhere near fluency and, being audio-only, totally ignores literacy, but by the end of the course you should have enough skill to actively engage the language.</p>\n<p>After finishing MT, you should have a good grasp of the grammar. A good follow-up course might be something like Assimil (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLvTEqXqlsI\">video overview</a>), which would take care of literacy and fill in any remaining grammar gaps. After that, the only thing missing is vocabulary and general practice. This is the point where traditional language teaching ends, but graded readers, parallel texts and so on, combined with <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition\">spaced repetition</a>, solve this problem nicely.

{"html": "<h2 id=\"Purpose_of_Review\">Purpose of Review</h2>\n<p>Owen\u2019s <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/7d1/scientifically_optimizing_education_hard_problem/\">recent post</a> brought up the topic of optimizing education. One particular approach, Direct Instruction (Misha\u2019s <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/7g3/what_direct_instruction_is/\">better explanation</a>), claims to have essentially solved the problem. In particular, Direct Instruction (DI) does allegedly not only work for basic reading skills, but any teaching task. Owen brought up the Michel Thomas language courses as a good application. Language learning is one of my main interests, so I gave the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Michel-Thomas-Foundation-Course-French/dp/0340938919/\">French Foundation</a> course a try.</p>\n<p>The main point of the review is to summarize what Michel Thomas actually <em>does</em>, how it <em>differs</em> from other common paradigms and how <em>effective</em> it seems to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Nice for beginners and people with bad learning experiences; limited use afterwards. The audio-only aspect is very convenient. It complements other strategies well and I see it as a good proof-of-concept of DI-like methods for language learning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with a disclaimer. Michel Thomas (MT) is not officially a DI course and as far as I could google, Thomas propbably wasn\u2019t aware of DI at all. However, according to Solity's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Michel-Thomas-Jonathan-Solity/dp/0340928336\">The Language Revolution</a> and Owen, the reason MT works so well is that it applies (an approximation of) DI techniques. It is right now the best realistic example beyond the grade school level, so it\u2019ll have to do.</p>\n<p>I had some French in high school and thanks to fluency in German and English, I can read some French, but I have no active skill at all, nor have I ever used French in a serious way.</p>\n<p>I have now completed the first half of the French Foundation course and skimmed many other courses. You can listen to the first <a href=\"http://www.audible.co.uk/pd?asin=B004GYSQZC\">20 minutes here</a>; they are very representative. Furthermore you can read the <a href=\"http://www.michelthomas.com/downloads.php\">booklets</a> to get an idea of the material covered in each course. The whole course is audio-only, consists of 8 CDs (and 2 review CDs) and is intended to be listened to only once.<sup id=\"fnref:once\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn:once\">1</a></sup> There are several advanced courses which merely cover more grammar points and vocabulary. Structurally, they are all the same.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Method\">Method</h2>\n<p>MT teaches the course to two new students<sup id=\"fnref:students\"><a rel=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn:students\">2</a></sup>. You\u2019re supposed to take the role of a third student, pausing the recording whenever MT asks a question so that you can say your own answer. One of the two students also answers and you can compare your reply and listen to MT\u2019s advice and error correction. Both students are beginners, so most of your mistakes will be covered that way.</p>\n<p>MT introduces one language component at a time and makes you use it in a given sentence. He provides a short explanation first and then lets the students answer a couple of examples by giving them an English sentence and asking them to translate it into French. Each component is thus reinforced through many examples.</p>\n<p>MT also tries to combine the translation tasks over time by re-using partial sentences. This way, sentence quickly look complex, but always stay easy. (\u201cWhat impression do you have of the political and economical situation in France at the present time?\u201d is used about one hour in!)</p>\n<p>Vocabulary is only introduced as necessary and relies heavily on cognates. The primary focus is on teaching structure. MT strongly emphasizes not to guess or try to remember anything, but instead to rely on induction (\u201cDo not guess, but think it out!\u201d). This works because the examples are carefully chosen to be as obvious as possible. All translation tasks have only one correct answer. All production is tightly controlled. MT relies on the constant tests to see that the students are successfully keeping up. He is never unsure if some concept has been understood or not.</p>\n<p>Complex rules that might thematically belong together (like verb conjugations) are broken apart so that each individual new form or word is learned on its own. Similar rules that might be confused are deliberately spread out.</p>\n<p>MT stresses that you aren\u2019t supposed to try to remember anything. If you don\u2019t know something, then <em>he</em> has not succeeded as a teacher yet and he will take care of it, not you. He does this by doing manual <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition\">spaced repetition</a>, i.e. he repeats previous questions (or similar ones) over time and tests the students constantly. If they have trouble answering, then he quickly goes back to the relevant lesson. This is of course how most language textbooks are supposed to be used, but they rely entirely on the student doing the testing themselves. Instead, MT provides the complete lesson including all necessary repetitions so the student doesn\u2019t have to do anything at all except answer MT\u2019s constant stream of translation tasks.

We get interesting results when we ask people to report on their experience, while also observing their actions.</p>\n<p>If you ask a blindsight patient what they see in their scotoma, they respond to the point that they can't see anything there. However, if you tell them to do things like \"grab the thing in your scomata\" they can grasp it. If you ask them to guess what's in it, they can perform better than chance. Some blindsight patients can tell if something is moving in their scotoma, but they can't tell you what it is. They often describe this awareness as a hunch.</p>\n<p>Most people consider it fair to say that blindsight patients are not conscious of the things in their scotoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Attention and Conscious Experience</strong></p>\n<p>Patients with blindsight can act on visual information in their scotomas in some ways, but they can't notice it.</p>\n<p>Metzinger argues that humans don't have a conscious experience of what we can't pay attention to. Note: There's a difference between can't pay attention to, and not currently paying attention to.</p>\n<p>Visual information in the scotoma isn't accessible to the parts of my brain that plan, or the parts that cause me to say \"I can see X\". My unconscious is able to refer to this information for things in forced choice situations, but the information isn't available to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints on Theories of Consciousness</strong></p>\n<p>Any theory which says that you need to be conscious in order to do things is probably wrong. Also, robots work. And machine learning exists. See also unconscious goals.</p>\n<p>It's possible for your brain to refer to something, but not have it be consciously available to you. It's also possible to change what these things are.</p>\n<p>The parts of your brain causing you to say that you notice something can be cut off from the parts that let you do things. This implies that some neural processes lead to you being conscious and others don't, and that those processes can be interrupted without ruining everything.</p>\n<p><strong>Citations, Notes:</strong></p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>\"The Case of Blindsight\"&nbsp;by Weiskrantz&nbsp;in the Blackwell Companion to Consciousness (you can get it <a href=\"http://www.thatmarcusfamily.org/philosophy/Course_Websites/Contemporary/Readings/Weiskrantz.pdf\">here</a>, though there are other place on the internet that talk about blindsight)</p>\n<p>Heavily drawn from The Ego Tunnel and Being No One (both by Metzinger).</p>\n<p>Thanks to John Salvatier for reviewing drafts of this post.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "K82imMHxwbR5FikKP", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 18, "baseScore": 20, "extendedScore": null, "score": 5.1e-05, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "9994", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 16, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": {"html": "<p>Thomas Metzinger is a philosopher who pays lots of attention to cognitive science and psychology, and likes to think about consciousness.

However, if you tell them to do things like \"grab the thing in your scomata\" they can grasp it. If you ask them to guess what's in it, they can perform better than chance. Some blindsight patients can tell if something is moving in their scotoma, but they can't tell you what it is. They often describe this awareness as a hunch.</p>\n<p>Most people consider it fair to say that blindsight patients are not conscious of the things in their scotoma.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Attention_and_Conscious_Experience\">Attention and Conscious Experience</strong></p>\n<p>Patients with blindsight can act on visual information in their scotomas in some ways, but they can't notice it.</p>\n<p>Metzinger argues that humans don't have a conscious experience of what we can't pay attention to. Note: There's a difference between can't pay attention to, and not currently paying attention to.</p>\n<p>Visual information in the scotoma isn't accessible to the parts of my brain that plan, or the parts that cause me to say \"I can see X\". My unconscious is able to refer to this information for things in forced choice situations, but the information isn't available to me.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Constraints_on_Theories_of_Consciousness\">Constraints on Theories of Consciousness</strong></p>\n<p>Any theory which says that you need to be conscious in order to do things is probably wrong. Also, robots work. And machine learning exists. See also unconscious goals.</p>\n<p>It's possible for your brain to refer to something, but not have it be consciously available to you. It's also possible to change what these things are.</p>\n<p>The parts of your brain causing you to say that you notice something can be cut off from the parts that let you do things. This implies that some neural processes lead to you being conscious and others don't, and that those processes can be interrupted without ruining everything.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Citations__Notes_\">Citations, Notes:</strong></p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>\"The Case of Blindsight\"&nbsp;by Weiskrantz&nbsp;in the Blackwell Companion to Consciousness (you can get it <a href=\"http://www.thatmarcusfamily.org/philosophy/Course_Websites/Contemporary/Readings/Weiskrantz.pdf\">here</a>, though there are other place on the internet that talk about blindsight)</p>\n<p>Heavily drawn from The Ego Tunnel and Being No One (both by Metzinger).</p>\n<p>Thanks to John Salvatier for reviewing drafts of this post.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "sections": [{"title": "Attention and Conscious Experience", "anchor": "Attention_and_Conscious_Experience", "level": 1}, {"title": "Constraints on Theories of Consciousness", "anchor": "Constraints_on_Theories_of_Consciousness", "level": 1}, {"title": "Citations, Notes:", "anchor": "Citations__Notes_", "level": 1}, {"divider": true, "level": 0, "anchor": "postHeadingsDivider"}, {"anchor": "comments", "level": 0, "title": "24 comments"}], "headingsCount": 5}, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 24, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-09-22T18:55:30.374Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "AGI-2011 conference videos ", "slug": "agi-2011-conference-videos", "viewCount": null, "lastCommentedAt": "2017-06-17T04:00:33.168Z", "clickCount": null, "deletedDraft": false, "status": 2, "isFuture": false, "sticky": false, "stickyPriority": 2, "userIP": null, "userAgent": null, "referrer": null, "author": null, "user": {"username": "Dr_Manhattan", "createdAt": "2010-12-16T13:46:11.412Z", "isAdmin": false, "displayName": "Dr_Manhattan"}, "userId": "rhNqxRkdTL5KSCuJk", "domain": null, "pageUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NjHmS4nvQsBNGkv9i/agi-2011-conference-videos", "pageUrlRelative": "/posts/NjHmS4nvQsBNGkv9i/agi-2011-conference-videos", "linkUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NjHmS4nvQsBNGkv9i/agi-2011-conference-videos", "postedAtFormatted": "Thursday, September 22nd 2011", "emailShareUrl": "mailto:?subject=Interesting%20link%3A%20AGI-2011%20conference%20videos%20&body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20find%20this%20interesting%3A%0A%0AAGI-2011%20conference%20videos%20%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FNjHmS4nvQsBNGkv9i%2Fagi-2011-conference-videos%0A%0A(found%20via%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com)%0A%20%20", "twitterShareUrl": "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=AGI-2011%20conference%20videos%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FNjHmS4nvQsBNGkv9i%2Fagi-2011-conference-videos", "facebookShareUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FNjHmS4nvQsBNGkv9i%2Fagi-2011-conference-videos", "socialPreviewImageUrl": "", "question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 37, "htmlBody": "<p>Google tech talks published a bunch of video from AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) 2011 today, they're all linked from the conference site.

Abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<p>This chapter focuses on some emerging elements of a neuroscientific basis for behavioral game theory.&nbsp;The premise of this chapter is that game theory can be useful in helping to elucidate the neural basis of&nbsp;strategic thinking. The great strength of game theory is that it offers precision in defining what players&nbsp;are likely to do and suggesting algorithms of reasoning and learning. Whether people are using these&nbsp;algorithms can be estimated from behavior and from psychological observables (such as response times&nbsp;and eye tracking of attention), and used as parametric regressors to identify candidate brain circuits&nbsp;that appear to encode those regressors.</p>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This review article may be particularly interesting for those who suspect that game theory may play a major role in human value, perhaps even in ways that would make it more intuitively plausible that reasonable value extrapolation algorithms can be developed.</p>",

AIs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once upon a time, the US Army wanted to use neural networks to automatically detect&nbsp;camouflaged enemy tanks. &nbsp;The researchers trained a neural net on 50 photos of&nbsp;camouflaged tanks in trees, and 50 photos of trees without tanks. &nbsp;Using standard&nbsp;techniques for supervised learning, the researchers trained the neural network to a&nbsp;weighting that correctly loaded the training set - output \"yes\" for the 50 photos of&nbsp;camouflaged tanks, and output \"no\" for the 50 photos of forest. &nbsp;This did not ensure, or&nbsp;even imply, that new examples would be classified correctly. &nbsp;The neural network might&nbsp;have \"learned\" 100 special cases that would not generalize to any new problem. &nbsp;Wisely,&nbsp;the researchers had originally taken 200 photos, 100 photos of tanks and 100 photos of&nbsp;trees. &nbsp;They had used only 50 of each for the training set. &nbsp;The researchers ran the neural&nbsp;network on the remaining 100 photos, and without further training the neural network&nbsp;classified all remaining photos correctly. &nbsp;Success confirmed! &nbsp;The researchers handed the finished work to the Pentagon, which soon handed it back, complaining that in their own tests the neural network did no better than chance at discriminating photos.</p>\n<p>It turned out that in the researchers' data set, photos of camouflaged tanks had been taken&nbsp;on cloudy days, while photos of plain forest had been taken on sunny days. &nbsp;The neural&nbsp;network had learned to distinguish cloudy days from sunny days, instead of distinguishing camouflaged tanks from empty forest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I once stumbled across the source of this parable online, but now I can't find it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm curious: Are there any well-known examples of this kind of problem <em>actually</em>&nbsp;causing serious damage &mdash; say, when a narrow AI trained via machine learning was placed into a somewhat novel environment?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null,

"wordCount": 831, "htmlBody": "<p>I've mentioned in comments a couple of times that I don't consider formal systems to talk about themselves, and that consequently G&ouml;delian problems are irrelevant.&nbsp; So what am I actually on about?</p>\n<p>It's generally accepted in mathematical logic that a formal system which embodies Peano Arithmetic (PA) is able to talk about itself, by means of G&ouml;del numberings; statements and proofs within the system can be represented as positive integers, at which point \"X is a valid proof in the system\" becomes equivalent to an arithmetical statement about #X, the G&ouml;del number representing X.&nbsp; This is then diagonalised to produce the G&ouml;del sentence (roughly, g=\"There is no proof X such that the last line of X is g\", and incompleteness follows.&nbsp; We can also do things like defining \u25a1 (\"box\") as the function from S to \"There is a proof X in PA whose last line is S\" (intuitively, \u25a1S says \"S is provable in PA\").&nbsp; This then also lets us define the L&ouml;b sentence, and many other interesting things.</p>\n<p>But how do we <em>know</em> that \u25a1S &hArr; there is a proof of S in PA?&nbsp; Only by applying some <em>meta-theory</em>.&nbsp; And how do we <em>know</em> that statements reached in the meta-theory of the form \"thus-and-such is true of PA\" are true of PA?&nbsp; Only by applying a meta-meta-theory.&nbsp; There is <em>no</em> a-priori justification for the claim that \"A formal system is in principle capable of talking about other formal systems\", which claim is used by the proof that PA can talk about itself.&nbsp; (If I remember correctly, to prove that \u25a1 does what we think it does, we have to appeal to second-order arithmetic; and how do we know second-order arithmetic applies to PA?&nbsp; Either by invoking third-order arithmetic to analyse second-order arithmetic, or by recourse to an informal system.)</p>\n<p>Note also that the above is not a strange loop through the meta-level; we justify our claims about arithmetic<sub>n</sub> by appeal to arithmetic<sub>n+1</sub>, which is a separate thing; we never find ourselves back at arithmetic<sub>n</sub>.</p>\n<p>Thus the claim that formal systems can talk about themselves involves ill-founded recursion, what is sometimes called a \"skyhook\".&nbsp; While it may be a theorem of second-order arithmetic that \"the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is unprovable in PA\", one cannot conclude from second-order arithmetic alone that the \"PA\" in that statement <em>refers to</em> PA.&nbsp; It is however provable in third-order arithmetic that \"What second-order arithmetic calls \"PA\" is PA\", but that hasn't gained us much - it only tells us that second- and third-order arithmetic call the same thing \"PA\", it doesn't tell us whether this \"PA\" is PA.&nbsp; Induct on the arithmetic hierarchy to reach the obvious conclusion.&nbsp; (Though note that none of this prevents the Paris-Harrington Theorem from being a theorem of n-th order arithmetic &forall;n&ge;2)</p>\n<p>What, then, is the motivation for the above?&nbsp; Well, it is a basic principle of my philosophy that the only objects that are real (in a Platonic sense) are formal systems (or rather, <em>syntaxes</em>).&nbsp; That is to say, my ontology is the <del>set</del>class of formal systems.&nbsp; (This is not incompatible with the apparent reality of a physical universe; if this isn't obvious, I'll explain why in another post.)&nbsp; But if we allow these systems to have <em>semantics</em>, that is, we claim that there is such a thing as a \"true statement\", we start to have problems with completeness and consistency (namely, that we can't achieve the one and we can't prove the other, assuming PA).&nbsp; Tarski's undefinability theorem protects us from having to deal with systems which talk about truth in themselves (because they are necessarily inconsistent, assuming some basic properties), but if systems can talk about each other, and if systems can talk about provability within themselves (that is, if analogues to the \u25a1 function can be constructed), then nasty G&ouml;delian things end up happening (most of which are, to a Platonist mathematician, <em>deeply unsatisfying</em>).</p>\n<p>So instead we restrict the ontology to <em>syntactic systems devoid of any semantics</em>; the statement \"\"Foo\" is true\" is meaningless.&nbsp; There is a fact-of-the-matter as to whether a given statement can be reached in a given formal system, but that fact-of-the-matter cannot be meaningfully talked about in any formal system.&nbsp; This is a remarkably bare ontology (some consider it excessively so), but is at no risk from contradiction, inconsistency or paradox.&nbsp; For, what is \"P&and;&not;P\" but another, syntactic, sentence?&nbsp; Of course, applying a system which proves \"P&and;&not;P\" to the 'real world' is likely to be problematic, but the paradox or the inconsistency lies in the <em>application</em> of the system, and does not inhere in the system itself.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I am actually aiming to get somewhere with this, it's not just for its own sake (although the ontological and epistemological status of mathematics <em>is</em> worth caring about for its own sake).&nbsp; In particular I want to set up a framework that lets me talk about Eliezer's \"infinite set atheism\", because I think he's asking a wrong question.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Followed up by: <a title=\"The

Biases, those traits which affect everyone but me</strong></p>\n<p>I recently had the opportunity to run an exercise on bias and rationality with a group of (fellow) university students. I wasn't sure it was going to go down well. There's one response that always haunts me when it comes to introducing bias: That's an interesting description of other people but it doesn't describe me.</p>\n<p>I can't remember the details (and haven't been able to track them down), but I once read about an experiment on some bias, let's say it was <a title=\"hindsight bias\" href=\"/lw/il/hindsight_bias/\">hindsight bias</a>. The research team carried out a standard experiments which showed that the participants were biased as expected. After, they told these participants about hindsight bias. Most of the participants thought this was interesting and probably explained the actions of other people in the experiment but they didn't think it explained their own actions.</p>\n<p>So going into the presentation, this is what I was worried about: People thinking these biases were just abstract and didn't affect them.</p>\n<p>Then at the end, everyone's comments made it clear that this wasn't the case. They really had realised that these were biases which affected them. The question then is, what led them to reach this conclusion?</p>\n<p><strong>2. Living history, living bias<br /></strong></p>\n<p>All of the other planets (and the Earth) orbit the Sun. Once upon a time, we didn't believe this: We thought that the these planets (and the Sun) orbited the Earth.</p>\n<p>Imagine that you're alive all that time ago, when the balance of evidence has just swung so that it favours the theory that the planets orbit the Sun. However, at the time, you steadfastly insist that they orbit the Earth. Why? Because your father told you it did when you were a child and you always believe things your father told you. Then a friend explains all of the evidence in favour of the theory that the planets orbit the Sun. Eventually, you realise that you were mistaken all along and, at the same time, you realise something else: You realise that it was a mistake not to question a belief just because your father endorsed it.</p>\n<p>If you think about history, you learn what beliefs were wrong. <a title=\"Failing to learn from history\" href=\"/lw/iz/failing_to_learn_from_history/\">If you live history, you learn this and then you also learn what it feels like to mistakenly endorse an incorrect belief</a>. Maybe next time it occurs then, <a title=\"Making history available\" href=\"/lw/j0/making_history_available/\">you can avoid making the same error</a>.</p>\n<p>In teaching people about biases, I think its best to help students to live biases and not just think about them. That way, they'll know what it feels like to be biased and they'll know that <em>they</em> are biased.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Rationality puzzles</strong></p>\n<p>One of the best ways to do this, and the technique I used in my presentation, seems to be to use of rationality puzzles. Basically, these are puzzles where the majority of respondents tend to reason in a biased or fallacious way. Run a few of these puzzles and most students will reason incorrectly in at least one of them. This means&nbsp; them a chance to experience being biased. If lessons focused on an abstract presentation biases instead, the student would think about the bias but not live it in the same way.</p>\n<p>So on example rationality puzzle is the 2, 4, 6 task. When I ran this exercise for my presentation, I broke the group up into pairs and made one member of each pair the questioner and the other the respondent.</p>\n<p>The respondent was given a slip of paper containing a number rule written upon it. This was a rule that a sequence of three numbers could either meet or fail to meet. I won't mention what the rule was yet, to give those who haven't come across the puzzle a chance to think about how they would proceed.</p>\n<p>The questioner's job was to guess this rule. They were given one clue: The sequence 2, 4, 6 met the rule. The questioner was then allowed to ask whether other three number sequences met the rule and the respondent would let them know if it did. The questioner could ask about as many sequences as they wanted to and when they were confident they were to write their guess down (I limited the exercise to five minutes for practical purposes and everyone had written down an answer by then).</p>\n<p>The answer was: Any three numbers in ascending order. No students in the group got the right answer.</p>\n<p>I then used the exercise to explain a bias called positive bias.  First, I noted that only 21% of respondents reached the right answer to  this scenario. Then I pointed out that the interesting point isn't this  figure but rather why so few people reach the right answer.  Specifically, people think to test positive, rather than negative,  cases. In other words, they're more likely to test cases that their  theory predicts will occur (in this case, those that get a yes answer)  then cases that their theory predicts won't. So if someone's initial  theory was that the rule was, \"three numbers, each two higher than the  previous one\" then they might test \"10, 12, 14\" as this is a positive  case for their theory. On the other hand, they probably wouldn't test  \"10, 14, 12\" or \"10, 13, 14\" as these are negative cases for their  prediction of the rule.</p>\n<p>This demonstrates positive bias - the bias toward thinking to test positive, rather then negative, cases for their theory (see&nbsp;<a title=\"Positive bias look into the dark\" href=\"/lw/iw/positive_bias_look_into_the_dark\">here</a> for previous discussion of the 2, 4, 6 task on Less Wrong).</p>\n<p>Puzzles like this allow the student to live the bias and not just consider it on an abstract level.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>In teaching people about biases we should be trying to make them live biases, rather than just thinking about them. Rationality puzzles offer one of the best ways to achieve this.</p>\n<p>Of course, for any individual puzzle, some people will get the right answer. With the 2, 4, 6 puzzle in particular, <a title=\"246 puzzle in social settings\" href=\"/lw/7r8/living_bias_not_thinking_bias/4vni\">a number of us</a> have found people perform better on this task in casual, rather than formal, settings. The best way to deal with this is to present a series of puzzles that reveal a variety of different biases. Most people will reach the wrong answer in at least one puzzle.</p>\n<p><strong>5.

The researchers claim to have measured the 730-kilometre trip between CERN and its detector to within 20 centimetres. They can measure the time of the trip to within 10 nanoseconds, and they have seen the effect in more than 16,000 events measured over the past two years. Given all this, they believe the result has a significance of six-sigma &mdash; the physicists' way of saying it is certainly correct. The group will present their results tomorrow at CERN, and a preprint of their results will be posted on the physics website ArXiv.org.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #363636; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4; \">At least one other experiment has seen a similar effect before, albeit with a much lower confidence level. In 2007, the Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS) experiment in Minnesota saw neutrinos from the particle-physics facility Fermilab in Illinois arriving slightly ahead of schedule. At the time, the MINOS team downplayed the result, in part because there was too much uncertainty in the detector's exact position to be sure of its significance, says Jenny Thomas, a spokeswoman for the experiment. Thomas says that MINOS was already planning more accurate follow-up experiments before the latest OPERA result. \"I'm hoping that we could get that going and make a measurement in a year or two,\" she says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br />Perhaps the end of the era of the light cone and beginning of the era of the neutrino cone? I'd be curious to see your probability estimates for whether this theory pans out. Or other crackpot hypotheses to explain the results.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null,

wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only objects that are real (in a Platonic sense) are formal systems (or rather, syntaxes). That is to say, my ontology is the set of formal systems. (This is not incompatible with the apparent reality of a physical universe).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my experience, most people default<sup>1</sup> to na&iuml;ve physical realism: the belief that \"matter and energy and stuff exist, and they follow the laws of physics\".&nbsp; This view has two problems: how do you know stuff exists, and what makes it follow those laws?</p>\n<p>To the first - one might point at a rock, and say \"Look at that rock; see how it <em>exists</em> at me.\"&nbsp; But then we are relying on sensory experience; suppose the simulation hypothesis were true, then that sensory experience would be unchanged, but the rock wouldn't really <em>exist</em>, would it?&nbsp; Suppose instead that we are being simulated <em>twice</em>, on two different computers.&nbsp; Does the rock exist <em>twice as much</em>?&nbsp; Suppose that there are actually two copies of the Universe, physically existing.&nbsp; Is there any way this could in principle be distinguished from the case where only one copy exists?&nbsp; No; a manifest physical reality is observationally equivalent to N manifest physical realities, as well as to a single simulation or indeed N simulations.&nbsp; (This remains true if we set N=0.)</p>\n<p>So a true description requires that the idea of <em>instantiation</em> should drop out of the model; we need to think in a way that treats all the above cases as identical, that justifiably puts them all in the same bucket.&nbsp; This we can do if we claim that <em>that-which-exists</em> is precisely the <em>mathematical structure</em> defining the physical laws and the index of our particular initial conditions (in a non-relativistic quantum universe that would be the Schr&ouml;dinger equation and some particular wavefunction).&nbsp; Doing so then solves not only the first problem of na&iuml;ve physical realism, but the second also, since trivially <em>solutions to those laws</em> must follow those laws.</p>\n<p>But then why should we privilege our particular set of physical laws, when that too is just a source of indexical uncertainty?&nbsp; So we conclude that all possible mathematical structures have Platonic existence; there is no little XML tag attached to the mathematics of our own universe that states \"this one exists, is physically manifest, is instantiated\", and in this view of things such a tag is obviously superfluous; instantiation has dropped out of our model.</p>\n<p>When an agent in universe-defined-by-structure-A simulates, or models, or thinks-about, universe-defined-by-structure-B, they do not 'cause universe B to come into existence'; there is no refcount attached to each structure, to tell the Grand Multiversal Garbage Collection Routine whether that structure is still needed.&nbsp; An agent in A simulating B is not a causal relation from A to B; instead it is a causal relation from B to A!&nbsp; B defines the fact-of-the-matter as to what the result of B's laws is, and the agent in A will (barring cosmic rays flipping bits) get the result defined by B.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>So we are left with a Platonically existing multiverse of mathematical structures and solutions thereto, which can contain conscious agents to whom there will be every <em>appearance</em> of a manifest instantiated physical reality, yet no such physical reality exists.&nbsp; In the terminology of Max Tegmark (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0646v2\">The Mathematical Universe</a>) this position is the acceptance of the MUH but the rejection of the ERH (although the Mathematical Universe is an external reality, it's not an external <em>physical</em> reality).</p>\n<p>Reducing all of applied mathematics and theoretical physics to a syntactic formal system is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup>That is, when people who haven't thought about such things before do so for the first time, this is usually the first idea that suggests itself.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup>I haven't yet worked out what happens if a closed loop forms, but I think we can pull the same trick that turns formalism into syntacticism; or possibly, consider the whole system as a single mathematical structure which may have several stable states (indexical uncertainty) or no stable states (which I think can be resolved by 'loop unfolding', a process similar to that which turns the complex plane into a Riemann surface - but now I'm getting beyond the size of digression that fits in a footnote; a mathematical theory of causal relations between structures needs at least its own post, and at most its own <em>field</em>, to be worked out properly).</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform":

They need to <em>cache</em> as much as they can. They store answers to questions, so that no new thought is required to answer. Answers copied from others can end up in your head without you ever examining them closely. This makes you say things that you'd never believe if you thought them through. So examine your cached thoughts! Are they true?</blockquote>\n<p><br />Discuss the post here (rather than in the comments to the original post).<br /><br /><em>This post is part of the Rerunning the Sequences series, where we'll be going through Eliezer Yudkowsky's old posts in order so that people who are interested can (re-)read and discuss them.

To be truly creative you must avoid the cached thought. Think something actually new, not something that you heard was the latest innovation.

I've written down the equation. Tried to formulate an answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I still don't understand it. That being said, I've lived my entire life under the false mentality that maths is boring and painful, and it's just recently I've tried to actually understand the concepts I learn in school, and not just temporarily memorize them for the next exam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here's the problem, on Yudkowsky's post:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;\">\"1% of women at age forty who participate in routine screening have breast cancer.&nbsp; 80% of women with breast cancer will get positive mammographies.&nbsp; 9.6% of women without breast cancer will also get positive mammographies.&nbsp; A woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine screening.&nbsp; What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?\"&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>When Eliezer changes the percentages to real numbers:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;\">\"100 out of 10,000 women at age forty who participate in routine screening have breast cancer.&nbsp; 80 of every 100 women with breast cancer will get a positive mammography.&nbsp; 950 out of&nbsp; 9,900 women without breast cancer will also get a positive mammography.&nbsp; If 10,000 women in this age group undergo a routine screening, about what fraction of women with positive mammographies will actually have breast cancer?\"</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I see this equation, I can properly make the answer come out to 7.8 percent. I do this, by taking the 80 women, and dividing 80 women by the 80 women plus the 950 women, so 80/80+950 (or 80/1030=.078). So I get 7.8%, which should be the right answer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But when I try to do the same with percentages, it all gets sort of screwy. I take the 80 percent of women (.8) divided by that same 80 percent (.8) plus 9.5 percent of women without cancer who test postive for it (.095).

Its utility function must take multiple people's (extrapolated) preferences into account.</li>\n<li><em>Determinism</em>: Given the same choices, and the same utility function, the AI should always make the same decisions.</li>\n<li><em>Pareto efficiency</em>: If every (extrapolated) person prefers action A to action B, the AI should prefer A to B.</li>\n<li><em>Independence of irrelevant alternatives</em>: If we &mdash; a group of extrapolated preference-sets &mdash; prefer A to B, and a new option C is introduced, then we should still prefer A to B regardless of what we think about C.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now,&nbsp;<a href=\"/lw/1cy/arrows_theorem_is_a_lie/\">Arrow's impossibility theorem</a> says that we can only get the FOOMed AI's utility function to adhere to these criteria if the extrapolated preferences of each partially simulated agent are related to each other cardinally (\"A is 2.3x better than B!\") instead of ordinally (\"A is better than B, and that's all I can say\").</p>\n<p>Now, if you're an old-school ordinalist about preferences, you might be worried. Ever since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto\">Vilfredo Pareto</a> pointed out that cardinal models of a person's preferences go far beyond our behavioral data and that as far as we can tell utility has \"no natural units,\" some economists have tended to assume that, in our models of human preferences, preference must be represented ordinally and not cardinally.</p>\n<p>But if you're keeping up with the latest cognitive neuroscience, you might&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;be quite so worried. It turns out that <a href=\"/lw/71x/a_crash_course_in_the_neuroscience_of_human/\">preferences <em>are</em>&nbsp;encoded cardinally after all</a>, and they <em>do</em>&nbsp;have a natural unit: action potentials per second. With cardinally encoded preferences, we <em><a href=\"/lw/1cy/arrows_theorem_is_a_lie/\">can</a></em>&nbsp;develop a utility function that represents our preferences and adheres to the common-sense criteria listed above.</p>\n<p>Whaddya know? The last decade of cognitive neuroscience has produced a somewhat interesting result concerning the plausibility of CEV.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

"question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 1338, "htmlBody": "<p>After reading the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/19900/Achievements_Report_2008-2010.pdf\">FHI achievement report for 2008-2010</a>, I thought it might be useful to compare their achievements to those of SIAI during the same time period. Since SIAI does not have an equivalent report, I've mostly pulled the data of their achievements from the <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/blog/\">SIAI blog</a>.</p>\r\n<p>My intention here is to help figure out which organization makes better use of my donations. For that purpose, I'm only looking at actual concrete outputs, and ignoring achievements such as successful fundraising drives or the hiring of extra staff.</p>\r\n<p>For citation counts, I'm using Google Scholar data as-is. Note that this will include both self-cites and some cites from pages that really shouldn't be counted, since Google Scholar seems to be a bit liberal about what it includes in its database. I'm unsure as to whether or not the citation counts are very meaningful, since there hasn't been much time for anyone to cite papers published in 2010, say. But I'm including them anyway.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Future of Humanity Institute</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Publications. </strong>The Achievement Report highlights three books and 22 journal articles. In addition, FHI staff has written 34 book chapters for academic volumes, including <em>Companion to Philosophy of Technology</em>; <em>New Waves in Philosophy of Technology</em>; <em>Philosophy</em>: <em>Theoretical and Empirical Explorations</em>; and <em>Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics</em>.</p>\r\n<p>The three are the hardcover and paperback editions of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Human-Enhancement-Julian-Savulescu/dp/0199594961/\"><em>Human Enhancement</em></a>, as well as a paperback edition of <a href=\"http://www.anthropic-principle.com/book/book.html\"><em>Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy</em></a>. Human Enhancement has been cited 22 times. <em>Anthropic Bias</em> was originally published in 2002, so I'm not including its citation count.</p>\r\n<p>The highlighted 22 journal articles had been cited 59 times in total. The overwhelmingly most cited article was <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/cognitive.pdf\"><em>Cognitive Enhancement: Methods, Ethics, Regulatory Challenges</em></a> in <em>Science and Engineering Ethics</em>, with 39 cites. The runner-up was <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0810/0810.5515.pdf\"><em>Probing the Improbable: Methodological. Challenges for Risks with Low Probabilities and High Stake</em></a>, with 5 cites. The remaining articles had 0-3 cites. But while <em>Cognitive Enhancement</em> is listed as a 2009 paper, it's worth noting that the first draft version of it was posted on Nick Bostrom's website back in 2006, and it has had time to accumulate cites since then. If we exclude it, FHI's 2008-2010 papers have been cited 20 times.</p>\r\n<p>It's not listed in the Achievement Report, but I also want to include the 2008 <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/3853/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf\"><em>Whole Brain Emulation Roadmap</em></a>, which has been cited 15 times, bringing the total count (excluding <em>Cognitive Enhancement</em>) to 35.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Presentations. </strong>FHI members have given a total of 95 invited lectures and conference presentations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Media appearances. </strong>Some 100 media appearances, including print, radio, and television appearances, since January 2009. These include BBC television, New Scientist, National Geographic, The Guardian, ITV, Bloomberg News, Discovery Channel, ABC, Radio Slovenia, Wired Magazine, BBC world service, Volkskrant (German newspaper), Utbildningsradion (Swedish national radio), Mehr News Agency (Iranian), Mladina Weekly (Slovenian magazine), Jyllands-Posten and Weekenavisen (Danish newspapers), Bayerisher Rundfunk (German radio), The History Channel, O Estado de S&atilde;o Paulo (Brazillian newspaper), Euronews, Kvallsposten (Swedish newspaper), City Helsinki (Finnish radio), Focus, Dutch Film and Television Academy, The Smart Manager (Indian magazine), Il Sole 24 Ore (Italian monthly), The Bulletin of the Atomic Sciences, Time Magazine, Astronomy Now, and Radio Bar-Kulan (Kenya).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visitors. </strong>\"The Institute receives many requests from students and scholars who wish to visit the Institute, only a few of which are accepted because of capacity limitations. The FHI has hosted a number of distinguished academic visitors over the past two years within its various areas of activity, such as Profs. David Chalmers, Michael Oppenheimer, and Thomas Homer-Dixon.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Policy advice.</strong> The Achievement Report highlights 23 groups or events which have received policy advice from either Nick Bostrom or Anders Sandberg. These include the World Economic Forum, the Public Services Offices of the Prime Minister's Office of Singapore, the UK Home Office, If (Stockholm insurance company), Jane Street Capital, IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) for US Government, The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, and setting up a research network, \"A differential view of enhancement\", within the Volkswagen Foundation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Organized events. </strong>Three organized events. 1: Cognitive Enhancement Workshop. 2: Symposium on cognitive enhancement and related ethical and policy issues. 3: Uncertainty, Lags and Nonlinearity: Challenges to governance in a turbulent world.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Singularity Institute</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Publications. </strong>The <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/research/publications\">SIAI publications page</a> has 15 papers from the 2008-2010 period, of which 11 are listed under \"recent publications\", 1 under \"software\", and 3 under \"talks and working papers\". Of these, <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/upload/ECAPFoxShulman.pdf\"><em>Superintelligence does not imply benevolence</em></a> has been cited once. The rest all have no citations.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences\">The Sequences</a> were written during this time period. They consist of <a href=\"/lw/2kk/book_recommendations/37g8?context=1#37g8\">about a million words</a>, and might very well have a bigger impact than all the other FHI and SIAI articles together - though that's very hard to quantify.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Presentations and Media Appearances. </strong>The SIAI blog mentions a number of media appearances and presentations at various venues, but I don't have the energy to go through them all and count. From a quick eyeballing of the blog, though, SIAI has nowhere near as many presentations and media appearances as FHI.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visitors.</strong> The <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/aboutus/visitingfellows\">Visiting Fellows page</a> has a list of 27 Visiting Fellows from around the world, who attend or hold degrees from universities including Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Cambridge, Carnegie Mellon, Auckland University, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, and the University of California-Santa Barbara</p>\r\n<p><strong>Online communities and tools. </strong><em>Less Wrong</em> was founded in 2009, and Google Analytics says that by the end of 2010, it had had over a million unique visitors.</p>\r\n<p>Note that LW is an interesting case: as an FHI/SIAI collaboration, both organizations claim credit for it. However, since LW is to such a huge extent Eliezer's creation, and I'm not sure of what exactly the FHI contribution to LW <em>is</em>, I'm counting it as an SIAI and not a joint achievement.</p>\r\n<p>SIAI also created the <a href=\"http://theuncertainfuture.com/\"><em>Uncertain Future</em></a>, a tool for estimating the probability of AI.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Organized events.</strong> SIAI held Singularity Summits on all three years. The first <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/blog/2010/08/22/singularity-summit-australia-sept-7-11-12-melbourne/\">Singularity Summit Australia</a> was held in 2010. In 2008, SIAI co-sponsored the <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/blog/2008/09/19/nano-bio-info-cogno-revolutions-to-be-explored-at-convergence08/\">Converge unconference</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Ben Goertzel, acting as the SIAI Director of Research at the time, organized the <a href=\"http://agi-conf.org/2008/\">2008</a> and <a href=\"http://agi-conf.org/2009/\">2009</a> conferences on Artificial General Intelligence. He also co-organized a <a href=\"http://novamente.net/machinecs/index.html\">2009 workshop on machine consciousness</a>,</p>\r\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence projects. </strong>SIAI provided initial funding for the <a href=\"http://opencog.org/\">OpenCog</a> project, as well as sponsoring Google Summer of Code events relating to the project in <a href=\"http://blog.opencog.org/2008/09/05/opencog-google-summer-of-code-roundup/\">2008</a> and <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/blog/2009/05/27/google-summer-of-code-begins/\">2009</a>.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Overall</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Based on this data, which organization is more deserving of my money? Hard to say, especially since SIAI has been changing a lot. The general AGI research, for instance, isn't really something that's being pursued anymore, and Ben Goertzel is no longer with the organization. Eliezer is no longer writing the sequences, which were possibly the biggest SIAI achievement of the whole 2008-2010 period.</p>\r\n<p>Still, FHI's accomplishments seem a lot more impressive overall, suggesting that they might be a better target for the money. On the other hand, they are not as tightly focused on AI as SIAI is.</p>\r\n<p>One imporant question is also the amount of funding the two organizations have had: accomplishing a lot is easier if you have more money. If an organization has thrice as much money, they should be expected to achieve thrice as much. <a href=\"/lw/5il/siai_an_examination/\">SIAI's revenue</a> was $426,000 in 2008 and $628,000 in 2009. FHI's funding was <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/7sc/siai_vs_fhi_achievements_20082010/4w50\">around $711,000</a> for 10/2008 - 10/2009. I don't know the 2010 figure for either organization. The FHI report also says the following:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>To appreciate the significance of what has been accomplished, it should be kept in mind that the FHI has been understaffed for much of this period. One of our James Martin Research Fellows, Dr Rebecca Roache, has been on maternity leave for the past year. Our newest James Martin Research Fellow, Dr Eric Mandelbaum, who was recruited from an extremely strong field of over 170 applicants, has been in post for only two months. Thus, for half of the two-year period, FHI&rsquo;s research staff has consisted of two persons, Professor Nick Bostrom and Dr Anders Sandberg.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><a href=\"/lw/5il/siai_an_examination/\">SIAI - An Examination</a> notes that in both 2008 and 2009, SIAI paid salaries to three people, so for a while at least, the amount of full-time staff in the two organizations was roughly comparable.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null,

For thousands of years, the answer has seemed obvious: when faced with a difficult dilemma, we should carefully assess our options and spend a few moments consciously deliberating the information. Then, we should choose the toothpaste that best fits our preferences. This is how we maximize utility and get the most bang for the buck. We are rational agents &ndash; we should make decisions in a rational manner.</p>\n<p><strong>But what if rationality backfires? What if we make better decisions when we trust our gut instincts? While there is an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_gambling_task\">extensive</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Descartes-Error-Emotion-Reason-Human/dp/0380726475\">literature</a> on the potential <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_A._Klein\">wisdom</a> of human emotion, it&rsquo;s only in the last few years that researchers have demonstrated that the emotional system (aka <a href=\"http://edge.org/conversation/the-marvels-and-flaws-of-intuitive-thinking\">Type 1 thinking</a>) might excel at <em>complex</em> decisions, or those involving lots of variables.</strong> If true, this would suggest that the unconscious is better suited for difficult cognitive tasks than the conscious brain, that<em><strong> the very thought process we&rsquo;ve long disregarded as irrational and impulsive might actually be &ldquo;smarter&rdquo; than reasoned deliberation.</strong></em> This is largely because the unconscious is able to handle a surfeit of information, digesting the facts without getting overwhelmed. (Human reason, in contrast, has a very strict bottleneck and can only process about four bits of data at any given moment.)</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>The most widely cited demonstration of this theory is a 2006 <em>Science</em> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/311/5763/1005.abstract\">paper</a> led by Ap Dijksterhuis. (I wrote about the research in <em>How We Decide</em>.)</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>Dijksterhuis found that people given time to think in a rational manner &ndash; they could carefully contemplate each alternative &ndash; now chose the ideal car less than 25 percent of the time. In other words, they performed worse than random chance. However, subjects who were distracted for a few minutes found the best car nearly 60 percent of the time.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>While the Dijksterhuis work generated plenty of buzz, it failed <a href=\"http://journal.sjdm.org/9711/jdm9711.html\">several tests</a> of replication. This led many researchers to suggest that the supposed benefit of unconscious thought were an experimental accident, or perhaps a side-effect of incubation. [...] However, <strong>a new <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/emo/11/4/743/\">paper</a>, published this month</strong> in <em>Emotion</em> by scientists then at Cornell University, provided the best test yet of the possible advantages of using our emotions to make complex decisions.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>Once again, the &ldquo;detail-focused&rdquo; group excelled at making simple decisions. Thinking in a rational manner made them nearly 20 percent more effective at identifying the best car alternative when there were only sixteen total pieces of information. However, <strong>those focused on feelings proved far better at finding the best car in the complex condition. While deliberate thinkers barely beat random chance, those listening to their feelings identified the ideal option nearly 70 percent of the time. </strong>Similar results were found when the volunteers were quizzed about subjective choice quality, as <strong>those relying on their emotions tended to be much more satisfied with their car selection. </strong>[...] the advantages of emotional decision-making could be undone by a subsequent bout of deliberation, which suggests that we shouldn&rsquo;t doubt a particularly strong instinct, at least when the considering lots of information. They also demonstrated that this phenomenon isn&rsquo;t unique to cars: our feelings are also better at picking the best apartments and vacation spots.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>Thanks to this new research, however, it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly clear that our emotions have a logic all their own, that our instincts are often rooted in the processing powers of the unconscious brain. <strong>The massive computational capacity of the Type I system</strong> &ndash; its ability to process thousands of bits of data in parallel &ndash; ensures that we can analyze all the relevant information when assessing alternatives. As a result, we&rsquo;re able to make sense of the plethora of options in the toothpaste aisle, assigning each alternative an <a href=\"http://www-abc.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/users/r20/finucane00_the_affect_heuristic.pdf\">affective tag</a>: the best option is quickly associated with the most positive emotion. We know more than we know &ndash; that&rsquo;s what our feelings are trying to tell us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a

pondering how to sell my dad on the idea.</p>\n<p>This is somewhat urgent for a couple of reasons. First, he's already pushing sixty and would meet increased resistance in&nbsp;acquiring&nbsp;another life insurance policy at a much steeper rate than myself. Second, even given his age, he could afford to sign us <em>both</em> up easily, and after some consideration, convincing him seems like the <em>more efficient</em> path to being signed up <em>myself</em> than trying to arrange it for myself alone. And, well, he's my dad, and while he has his flaws, he's kind of awesome.</p>\n<p>The sticking point, I can easily predict, will be getting passed his Cached Skepticism towards the concept of Cryonics. He is proud of being Skeptical; it's important to his self-concept, so I need to hit him with an opening that he can't easily dismiss. I would predict that if I simply linked him to Alcor's webpage, absolutely nothing would happen. I need something that will <em>motivate him to investigate</em>.</p>\n<p>The frustrating part, is that I'm quite sure that if he'd never heard of cryonics before, he'd have no&nbsp;resistance&nbsp;to the idea beyond the basic pain of dispelling the emotional numbness towards a Certain Doom by suggesting it <em>might</em> not be certain after all. Unless my model of him is very much inaccurate, his <em>Cached Skepticism of Cryonics</em> is the only notable obstacle. I would&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;any recommendations on which if any articles in particular would be best for initially getting through that.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion":

false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 664, "htmlBody": "<p>I have a question on Boltzmann brains which I'd like to hear your opinions on - mostly because I don't know the answer to this....</p>\n<p>First of all - a Boltzmann brain is the idea that - in a sufficiently large and long-lived universe, a brain just like mine or yours will occasionally pop into existence by sheer fluke. It doesn't happen very often - in fact it happens very, very infrequently. The brain will go on to have an experience or two before ceasing to exist on the grounds that it's surrounded by vacuum and cold - which is not a very good place for a disembodied brain to be.</p>\n<p>Such a brain would have a very short life. Well, by a greater fluke, some of them might last for a longer time, but the balance of probabilities is that most boltzmann brains that think they had a long life merely had a lot of false memories of this life, planted by the fluke of their sudden pop into existence. And in their few seconds of life, they never got to realise that they didn't actually live that life, and their memories make no sense.</p>\n<p>Well, boltzmann brains don't pop into existence by fluke very often - in the whole life of the observable universe it's overwhelmingly likely that it's never happened.</p>\n<p>What might be more likely to happen? Well, you could have half a Boltzmann brain instead, and by sheer fluke, have the nerves leading from that half-brain stimulated as if the other half was there during the few seconds of the half-brain's life. This is still extremely unlikely, but tremendously more likely than having a whole Boltzmann brain appear. And the half-brain still thinks it has the same experience as before.</p>\n<p>There is of course nothing to stop us from continuing this. Suppose we have a one-quarter brain? Much more probable. One millionth? Even more probable. Maybe even single elements of a nerve cell? More probable still. The smaller the piece is, the less of a fluke you need for it to come into existence, and the less of a fluke you need to continue to supply all the same inputs that it would have had in the event that the whole brain appeared.</p>\n<p>So we keep dividing down until we hit the opposite problem. As we divide and divide the Boltzmann brain, all the time ensuring that the part we had left had the same experience as before, we eventually get down to really simple processes that we can easily simulate, and which happen in the real universe all the time. And inputs which also happen all the time. This type of 'boltzmann brain' is extremely likely to happen.</p>\n<p>I can sort of answer part of it. Let's forget about brains for a moment and assume it's a PC that just bubbled out of the vacuum, along with something that can power it for a bit. We can do the same thing - dividing it down into smaller parts until we get just a transistor - then below that maybe just a minimal switch made out of maybe some atomic collisions. The complete PC that bubbled up can run my web browser or whatever. The subdivided parts of it continue to act in the same way as before, because by fluke we keep providing their inputs. Right at the bottom of the stack we have a simple switch, or perhaps memory that can either be 1 or 0 - it's still doing the same things that allow the complete PC to run a complex program, but the complexity of that higher level is no longer there.</p>\n<p>The problem is partially a sensory one. With the brain case, we accept that we have consciousness when the whole brain is there. It's still there when we separate the parts and wire them together. It's still there when we fluke out the inputs on one side?? It's still there when all the parts are not actually connected any more?</p>\n<p>Over to you....</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null,

Niether has given me reasons, those numbers are opaque.

[1]</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: medium; max-width: 700px;\">In order to see how likely this is to work, we should look at the process. I would sign up with a cryonics company and for life insurance. I'd go on living, enjoying my life and the people around me, paying my annual fees, until some point when I died. After death they would drain my blood, replace it with something that doesn't rupture cell walls when it freezes, freeze me in liquid nitrogen, and leave me there for a long time. At some point, probably after the development of nanotechnology, people would revive me, probably as a computer program.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: medium; max-width: 700px;\">There's a lot of steps there, and it's easy to see ways they could go wrong.

Even at 1:2 odds this is less effective than Village Reach at averting death [2], so this needs to come out of my 'money spent on me' budget. I think $10,000/year is about the most I'd be willing to spend. It's a lot, but not dying would be pretty nice. This means I'd need odds of 1:33 to sign up.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: medium; max-width: 700px;\">[2] Counter argument: you should care about quality adjusted life years and not deaths averted. Someone revived maybe should expect to have millenia of life at very high quality. This seems less likely to me than just the claim \"will be revived\". A lot less likely.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: medium; max-width: 700px;\">[3] In order to deal with independence issues, all my probability guesses are conditional on everything above them not happening. Each of these things must go right, so this works. For example, society collapsing and my cryonics organization going out of business are very much not independent. So the probability assigned to the latter is the chance that society won't collapse, but my organization goes out of business anyway. This means I can just multiply up the subelements to get probabilities for sections, and then multiply up sections to get an overall probability.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: medium; max-width: 700px;\">[4] This has a lot in common with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/WillCryonicsWork.html\">Warren formula</a>, which was inspired by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation\">Drake</a>&nbsp;equation.

(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis\">Analysis</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd like to offer one more technique for tackling hard questions: <strong>Hack away at the edges</strong>.</p>\n<p>General history books compress time so much that they often give the impression that major intellectual breakthroughs result&nbsp;from sudden strokes of insight. But when you read a history of just <em>one</em>&nbsp;breakthrough, you realize how much \"chance favors the prepared mind.\" You realize how much of the stage had been set by others, by previous advances, by previous mistakes, by a soup of ideas crowding in around the central insight made later.</p>\n<p>It's this picture of the history of mathematics and science that makes me feel quite comfortable working on hard problems by hacking away at their edges.</p>\n<p>I don't know how to build Friendly AI. Truth be told, I doubt humanity will figure it out before going extinct. The whole idea might be impossible or confused. But I'll tell you this: I doubt the problem will be solved by getting smart people to sit in silence and <em>think real hard </em>about decision theory and metaethics. If the problem can be solved, it will be solved by dozens or hundreds of people hacking away at the tractable edges of Friendly AI subproblems, drawing novel connections, inching toward new insights, drawing from others' knowledge and intuitions, and doing lots of tedious, boring work.</p>\n<p>Here's what happened when I encountered the problem of Friendly AI and decided I should for the time being&nbsp;do research&nbsp;on the problem rather than, say, trying to start a few businesses and donate money. I realized that I didn't see a clear path toward solving the problem, but I <em>did</em>&nbsp;see tons of apparently relevant research that could be done around the edges of the problem, especially with regard to friendliness content (because metaethics is my background). Snippets of my thinking process look like this:</p>\n<p><em>Friendliness content is about human values. Who studies human values, besides philosophers? Economists and neuroscientists. Let's look at what they know. Wow, neuroeconomics is <a href=\"/lw/71x/a_crash_course_in_the_neuroscience_of_human/\">far more advanced</a> than I had realized, and almost none of it has been mentioned by anybody researching Friendly AI! Let me hack away at that for a bit, and see if anything turns up.</em></p>\n<p><em>Some people approach metaethics/CEV with the idea that humans share a concept of 'ought', and figuring out what that is will help us figure out how human values are. Is that the right way to think about it? Lemme see if there's research on what concepts are, how much they're shared between human brains, etc. Ah, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Making-Concepts-Developmental-Cognitive-Neuroscience/dp/0199549222/\">there</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Doing-without-Concepts-Edouard-Machery/dp/0199837562/\">is</a>! I'll hack away at this next.</em></p>\n<p><em>CEV involves the modeling of human preferences. Who studies that? Economists do it in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_modelling\">choice modeling</a>, and AI programmers do it in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_elicitation\">preference elicitation</a>. They even have <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/vrpgtuugqxv7cncy/\">models</a> for dealing with conflicting desires, for example. Let me find out what they know...</em></p>\n<p><em>CEV also involves preference extrapolation. Who has studied that? Nobody but philosophers, unfortunately, but maybe they've found something. They call such approaches \"ideal preference\" or \"full information\" accounts of value. I can check into that.</em></p>\n<p>You get the idea.</p>\n<p>This isn't the only way to solve hard problems, but when problems are sufficiently hard, then hacking away at their edges may be just about <em>all</em>&nbsp;you can do. And as you do, you start to see where the problem is more and less tractable. Your intuitions about how to solve the problem become more and more informed by regular encounters with it from all angles. You learn things from one domain that end up helping in a different domain. And, inch by inch, you make progress.</p>\n<p>Of course you want to be strategic about how you're tackling the problem. But you also don't want to end up thinking in circles because the problem is too hard to even think strategically about how to tackle it.</p>\n<p>You also shouldn't do 3 months of thinking and never write any of it down because you know what you've thought isn't quite right. Hacking away at a tough problem involves lots of wrong solutions, wrong proposals, wrong intuitions, and wrong framings. Maybe somebody will know how to fix what you got wrong, or maybe your misguided intuitions will connect to something they know and you don't and spark a useful thought in their head.</p>\n<p>Okay, that's all.

Epistemic utility theory is inspired by traditional utility theory, so let's begin with a quick summary of that.</p>\n<p>Traditional utility theory (also known as decision theory) explores a particular strategy for establishing the norms that govern which actions it is rational for us to perform in a given situation.  The framework for the theory includes <em>states of the world</em>,  <em>actions</em>, and, for each agent, a <em>utility function</em>, which takes a state of the world and an action and returns a measure of the extent to which the agent values the outcome of performing that action at that world. We call this measure the <em>utility</em> of the outcome at the world.</p>\n<p>[...] we might say that an agent ought to perform an action that has maximal expected utility, where the expected utility of an action is obtained by weighting its utility at each state of the world by the credence assigned to that state of the world, and summing.  This norm is called <strong>Maximize Expected Utility</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a

This is about passion for failure. I feel the concept is thrown around a lot in the more creative <a href=\"http://timharford.com/books/adapt/\">business circles</a>, but ultimately I think they fail to capture the personal importance of trying and (comfortably) failing at your goals.</p>\n<p>Of course we all pick up and leave hobbies, we do this automatically as interest rises and wanes. <a href=\"/lw/un/on_doing_the_impossible\">This is not trying</a>. Not when your young, not when you have so little to lose and so much to learn. Simply being outgoing and wanting to try things will not <a href=\"/lw/un/on_doing_the_impossible\">surmount the impossible</a>. This is about the goals which drive you, which keep you up at night and get you up in the morning.</p>\n<p>As individuals predicting ourselves, our predictive power is laughable. It can't easily be done, and the bigger your goals, the more wildly your chances of reaching them vary from what you thought possible. Just as our ability to know our reasoning is confounded by the sheer <a href=\"/lw/6mj/trivers_on_selfdeception/\" target=\"_blank\">deceptiveness of our minds</a>, we base decisions off a even more complex world through the <a href=\"http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9781921640858/future-babble-why-expert-predictions-are-fail-and-why-we-believe-themanyway\">fractured crystal ball in our head</a>. Yet we constantly try to measure ourselves and our future in ways that seemingly assume we are machines or programs, with clear functions to fulfill and performance to measure by.**</p>\n<p>We need to be comfortable enough with failure to seek our goals out with bloody minded perseverance, and then take pride in the leftover harvest of failure. In my case, realizing that if&nbsp; I hadn't tried so hard to reach a grand, near untouchable goal, I would not have picked up all the benefits that come from trying. Realizing that if you tried hard enough, you would have gotten somewhere, even if not checking the box. The realization that I would have to see a lot of failure before I started getting anything like self-progress, and then some. It started a string of failures that have earned me more friends and skills&nbsp; and opportunities than I could have dreamed of but 2 years ago - and I would surely be a success in the mind of the young man who made that first goal.</p>\n<p>Believing in your goals is important for doing the impossible. You must not, however, fall into the trap of thinking of your goals as milestones of satisfaction, deliverance or 'the good life'. <a href=\"/lw/4su/how_to_be_happy/\">That's not how happiness works</a>. And these measures nearly cost me my mind.</p>\n<p>Individual Goals are there for direction - promises you make to yourself to concentrate effort in productive areas, thus leading to overall destruction &amp; creation. Breaking them should not be taken lightly, each should be a covenant to do your damned best. But when you do break them, if you did your best , you would have achieved something to be happy about - the promise stops being a measure, and becomes a guide. As a personal goal should be.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>* Separate stories really. <br />** Alright, weightloss may be covered by this, as well as the more tactical elements of hard work and study...</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "RkA3yZuAs9gd47yQs", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 6, "baseScore": -7, "extendedScore": null, "score": -4e-06, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "10124", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": -5, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": true, "tableOfContents": {"html": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_This_is_aimed_at_those__like_me__who_cursed_the_sky_and_themselves_for_not_being_smart__efficient__or_disciplined_enough_to_change_the_way_they_wanted_to__\">(This is aimed at those, like me, who cursed the sky and themselves for not being smart, efficient, or disciplined enough to change the way they wanted to.)</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most of us struggle to remain driven.

I feel the concept is thrown around a lot in the more creative <a href=\"http://timharford.com/books/adapt/\">business circles</a>, but ultimately I think they fail to capture the personal importance of trying and (comfortably) failing at your goals.</p>\n<p>Of course we all pick up and leave hobbies, we do this automatically as interest rises and wanes. <a href=\"/lw/un/on_doing_the_impossible\">This is not trying</a>. Not when your young, not when you have so little to lose and so much to learn. Simply being outgoing and wanting to try things will not <a href=\"/lw/un/on_doing_the_impossible\">surmount the impossible</a>. This is about the goals which drive you, which keep you up at night and get you up in the morning.</p>\n<p>As individuals predicting ourselves, our predictive power is laughable. It can't easily be done, and the bigger your goals, the more wildly your chances of reaching them vary from what you thought possible. Just as our ability to know our reasoning is confounded by the sheer <a href=\"/lw/6mj/trivers_on_selfdeception/\" target=\"_blank\">deceptiveness of our minds</a>, we base decisions off a even more complex world through the <a href=\"http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9781921640858/future-babble-why-expert-predictions-are-fail-and-why-we-believe-themanyway\">fractured crystal ball in our head</a>. Yet we constantly try to measure ourselves and our future in ways that seemingly assume we are machines or programs, with clear functions to fulfill and performance to measure by.**</p>\n<p>We need to be comfortable enough with failure to seek our goals out with bloody minded perseverance, and then take pride in the leftover harvest of failure. In my case, realizing that if&nbsp; I hadn't tried so hard to reach a grand, near untouchable goal, I would not have picked up all the benefits that come from trying. Realizing that if you tried hard enough, you would have gotten somewhere, even if not checking the box. The realization that I would have to see a lot of failure before I started getting anything like self-progress, and then some. It started a string of failures that have earned me more friends and skills&nbsp; and opportunities than I could have dreamed of but 2 years ago - and I would surely be a success in the mind of the young man who made that first goal.</p>\n<p>Believing in your goals is important for doing the impossible. You must not, however, fall into the trap of thinking of your goals as milestones of satisfaction, deliverance or 'the good life'. <a href=\"/lw/4su/how_to_be_happy/\">That's not how happiness works</a>. And these measures nearly cost me my mind.</p>\n<p>Individual Goals are there for direction - promises you make to yourself to concentrate effort in productive areas, thus leading to overall destruction &amp; creation. Breaking them should not be taken lightly, each should be a covenant to do your damned best. But when you do break them, if you did your best , you would have achieved something to be happy about - the promise stops being a measure, and becomes a guide. As a personal goal should be.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>* Separate stories really. <br>** Alright, weightloss may be covered by this, as well as the more tactical elements of hard work and study...</p>", "sections": [{"title": "(This is aimed at those, like me, who cursed the sky and themselves for not being smart, efficient, or disciplined enough to change the way they wanted to.)", "anchor": "_This_is_aimed_at_those__like_me__who_cursed_the_sky_and_themselves_for_not_being_smart__efficient__or_disciplined_enough_to_change_the_way_they_wanted_to__", "level": 1}, {"title": "Abject failure.

"socialPreviewImageUrl": "", "question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 701, "htmlBody": "<p>Currently, LWers get +1 karma for a comment upvote, and +10 karma for a main post upvote. But clearly, there are other valuable things LWers could do for the community besides writing comments and posts. Writing isn't everyone's <em>forte</em>. Why not award karma for doing productive non-writing things? It's probably not optimal that karma and the community status that comes with it are awarded only for the thing that myself and a few other people are good at. For example, I <em>really</em> wish LW could award karma to programmers for improving LW.</p>\n<p>The challenge is doing it fairly, in a way that doesn't alienate too many people. But there might be a workable way to do this, so let's explore.</p>\n<p>Perhaps tasks could be assigned karma award amounts by LW editors (Nesov, Eliezer, Louie, etc.), or even just one person who is appointed as the Karma Genie.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write a 5-page document describing how to use the Less Wrong virtual machine to hack new features into Less Wrong. <strong>900 points</strong>.</li>\n<li>Add a Facebook 'Like' button to the left of the up-down vote buttons on every post. <strong>700 points</strong>.</li>\n<li>Collect PDFs for every paper on debiasing thinking error X, upload the ZIP file to <a href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/\">mediafire</a>. <strong>700 points</strong>.</li>\n<li>Write a single-page introduction to The Sequences that makes them easier to navigate and see the value of. <strong>800 points</strong>.</li>\n<li>Launch a new LessWrong meetup group and hold at least three meetings. <strong>1200 points</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>Another possibility is to do what <a href=\"http://what.cd/\">what.cd</a> does with upload ratio. The more you upload, the better your upload ratio. But, you can trade in megabytes of your 'uploaded data' count for 'requests'. For example, if you wish somebody would upload RareAlbumX, you can trade in 500 megabytes of your uploaded data count. This lowers your upload ratio, which can be rebuilt by uploading more, and incentivizes someone to upload RareAlbumX. If somebody uploads RareAlbumX, the 500 megabytes (minus a small tax) is added to their 'uploaded data' count, which raises their status and&nbsp;privileges&nbsp;in the community.</div>\n<div>A what.cd-inspired system for LW would look like this: People could write a paragraph or two outlining the project they'd like to see done. Then, people could 'donate' karma to the project's karma award amount. If I <em>really</em>&nbsp;wanted to see somebody add the Facebook 'Like' button to LW, I could donate 2000 of my karma points to the award, and other people could donate some of their karma to that project, too. Maybe the award would eventually rise to 5000 karma points - a pretty damn good reason for some programmer on LW to write the code and make it work.</div>\n<div>In this scenario, editors would not dictate how valuable certain projects are, but would instead merely verify that the completed work met the specifications of the project. Editors would also have 'veto' power on projects. So, if somebody proposed a project to add a dancing Barney GIF to the front page, but LW editors decided they didn't want this, they would kill the project and any karma already donated to it would be returned to the original donors. Or better yet, projects would have to be approved before they showed up on the site.</div>\n<div>One difficulty here is that karma ranking boards still wouldn't optimally reflect status. Suppose PersonA did a ton of good work on Less Wrong and got 10,000 karma, and then donated all of that karma toward making some great project highly incentivized. This person has done two wonderful things - all the wonderful work and incentivizing more wonderful work - but they have 0 karma to show for it. On the other hand, it may be fair enough that people who accumulate karma can have more power over which particular good things are likely to happen as a result of karma incentivization.</div>\n<div>Also, there should probably be more incentives for gaining karma in general, as there are incentives for gaining upload ratio on what.cd. Rising through the karma ranks should give users special&nbsp;privileges&nbsp;that are actually desired.</div>\n<div>Basically, there are tons of useful projects that people could be doing, and LessWrong cannot possibly be currently optimized for incentivizing those projects. So... what's the best solution we can come up with?</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false,

beliefs and work before</a>. Now, he claims to <a href=\"http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/papers/outline.pdf\"> have a proof of a contradiction in Peano Arithmetic</a>; which if correct is not that specific to PA but imports itself into much weaker systems. I'm skeptical of the proof but haven't had the time to look at it in detail. There seem to be two possible weakpoints in his approach. His approach is to construct a system Q_0^* which looks almost but not quite a fragment of PA and then show that PA both proves this system's consistency and proves its inconsistency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, he may be mis-applying the Hilbert-Ackermann theorem-when it applies is highly technical and can be subtle. I don't know enough to comment on that in detail. The second issue is that in trying to show that he can use finitary methods to show there's a contradiction in Q_0^* he may have proven something closer to Q_0^* being omega-inconsistent. Right now, I'm extremely skeptical of this result. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If anyone is going to find an actual contradiction in PA or ZFC it would probably be Nelson.&nbsp;There some clearly interesting material here such as using a formalization of the &nbsp;surprise examiation/unexpected hanging to get a new proof of of Godel's Second Incompleteness Theorem. The exact conditions which this version of Godel's theorem applies &nbsp;may be different from the conditions under which the standard theorem can be proven.&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true,

I'd been raised to believe that God was necessary for meaning, morality, and purpose. My skin felt cold and my tongue felt like cardboard. This was the beginning of the darkest part of my life, but the seed of my later happiness.</p>\n<p>I grew up in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Minnesota\">Cambridge, Minnesota</a> &mdash; a town of 5,000 people and 22 Christian churches (at the time). My father was (and still is) pastor of a small church. My mother volunteered to support Christian missionaries around the world.</p>\n<p>I went to church and Bible study every week. I prayed often and earnestly. For 12 years I attended a Christian school that taught Bible classes and creationism. I played in worship bands. As a teenager I made trips to China and England to tell the godless heathens there about Jesus. I witnessed miraculous healings unexplained by medical science.</p>\n<p>And I <em>felt the presence of God</em>. Sometimes I would tingle and sweat with the Holy Spirit. Other times I felt led by God to give money to a certain cause, or to pay someone a specific compliment, or to walk to the cross at the front of my church and <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=3377\">bow before it during a worship service</a>.</p>\n<p>Around age 19 I got depressed. But then I read Dallas Willard&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Divine-Conspiracy-Rediscovering-Hidden-Life/dp/0060693339/\">The Divine Conspiracy</a></em>, a manual for how to fall in love with God so that following his ways is not a burden but a natural and painless product of loving God. And one day I saw a leaf twirling in the wind and it was so beautiful &mdash; like the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGWU4QhJ4L8\">twirling plastic bag</a> in&nbsp;<em>American Beauty</em> &mdash; that I had an epiphany. I realized that everything in nature was a gift from God to me. Grass, lakes, trees, sunsets &mdash; all these were gifts of beauty from my Savior to me. That's how I fell <em>in love</em>&nbsp;with God,&nbsp;and he delivered me from my depression.</p>\n<p>I moved to Minneapolis for college and was attracted to a Christian group led by <a href=\"http://www.markvans.info/\">Mark van Steenwyk</a>. Mark&rsquo;s small group of well-educated Jesus-followers are 'missional' Christians: they think that loving and serving others in the way of Jesus is more important than doctrinal truth. That resonated with me, and we lived it out with the poor immigrants of Minneapolis.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Doubt</h4>\n<p>By this time I had little interest in church structure or doctrinal disputes. I just wanted to <em>be like Jesus</em> to a lost and hurting world. So I decided I should try to find out who Jesus actually was. I began to study the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus\">Historical Jesus</a>.</p>\n<p>What I learned, even when reading <em>Christian</em> scholars, <a href=\"http://godtaughtme.wordpress.com/2007/01/10/rediscovering-jesus/\">shocked me</a>. The gospels were written decades after Jesus' death, by non-eyewitnesses. They are riddled with contradictions, legends, and known lies. Jesus and Paul disagreed on many core issues. And how could I accept miracle claims about Jesus when I outright rejected other ancient miracle claims as superstitious nonsense?</p>\n<p>These discoveries scared me. It was not what I had wanted to learn. But now I had to know the truth. I studied the Historical Jesus, the history of Christianity, the Bible, theology, and the philosophy of religion. Almost everything I read &mdash; even the books written by conservative Christians &mdash; gave me <em>more</em> reason to doubt, not less. What preachers had taught me from the pulpit was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=4669\">not what they had learned in seminary</a>. My discovery of the difference had just the effect on me that conservative Bible scholar Daniel B. Wallace <a href=\"http://bible.org/article/gospel-according-bart\">predicted</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The intentional dumbing down of the church for the sake of filling more pews will ultimately lead to defection from Christ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I started to panic. I felt like my best friend &mdash; my source of purpose and happiness and comfort &mdash; was dying. And worse, <em>I was killing him</em>. If only I could have faith! If only I could unlearn all these things and <em>just believe</em>. I cried out with the words from Mark 9:24, \"Lord, help my unbelief!\"</p>\n<p>I tried. For every atheist book I read, I read five books by the very best Christian philosophers. But the atheists made plain, simple sense, and the Christian philosophers were lost in a fog of big words that tried to hide the weakness of their arguments.</p>\n<p>I did everything I could to keep my faith. But I couldn&rsquo;t do it. I couldn&rsquo;t force myself to believe what I knew wasn&rsquo;t true. So I finally let myself whisper the horrifying truth out loud: <em>There is no God</em>.</p>\n<p>I told my dad, and he said I had been led astray because I was arrogant to think I could get to truth by <em>studying</em>&nbsp;&mdash; I was \"relying too much on my own strength.\"&nbsp;Humbled and encouraged, I started a new quest to find God. I <a href=\"http://godtaughtme.wordpress.com/2007/01/17/short-story/\">wrote</a> on my blog:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been humbled. I was &ldquo;doing discipleship&rdquo; in my own strength, because I thought I was smart enough and disciplined enough. [Now] having surrendered my prideful and independent ways to him, I can see how my weakness is God&rsquo;s strength.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve repented. I was deceived because I did not let the Spirit lead me into truth. Now I ask for God&rsquo;s guidance in all quests for knowledge and wisdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve been born again, again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It didn&rsquo;t last. Every time I reached out for some reason &mdash; any reason &mdash; to believe, God simply wasn&rsquo;t there. I tried to believe despite the evidence, but I couldn&rsquo;t believe a lie. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>No matter how much I missed him, I couldn&rsquo;t bring Jesus back to life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>New Joy and Purpose</h4>\n<p>Eventually I realized that millions of people have lived lives of incredible meaning, morality, and happiness without gods.&nbsp;I soon realized I could be <em>more</em> happy and moral without God than I ever was <em>with</em> him.</p>\n<p>In many ways, I regret wasting more than 20 years of my life on Christianity, but there are a few things of value I took from my life as an evangelical Christian.&nbsp;I know what it&rsquo;s like to be a true believer. I know what it&rsquo;s like to fall in love with God and serve him with all my heart. I know what&rsquo;s it like to experience his presence.&nbsp;I know what it&rsquo;s like to isolate one part of my life from reason or evidence, and I know what it&rsquo;s like to think that is a <em>virtue</em>.&nbsp;I know what it&rsquo;s like to be confused by the Trinity, the failure of prayers, or Biblical contradictions but to genuinely embrace them as the mystery of God. I know what it&rsquo;s like to believe God is so far beyond human reason that we can&rsquo;t understand him, but at the same time to fiercely believe I know the details of how he wants us to <em>behave</em>.</p>\n<p>I can talk to believers with understanding. I've experienced God the same way they have.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more important, I have a <em>visceral knowledge</em>&nbsp;that I can experience something personally, and be confident&nbsp;of it, and be <em>completely wrong</em>&nbsp;about it. I also have a gut understanding of <em>how wonderful it can be to <a href=\"/lw/i9/the_importance_of_saying_oops/\">just say \"oops\" already</a> and change your mind</em>.</p>\n<p>I suspect this is why it was so easy for me, a bit later, to quickly change my mind about free will, about metaethics, about political libertarianism, and about many other things. It was also why I became so interested in the cognitive science of how our beliefs can get so screwy, which eventually led me to Less Wrong, where I finally encountered that <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf\">famous paragraph</a> by I.J. Good:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I remember reading that paragraph and immediately thinking something like: <em>Woah. Umm... yeah... woah. That... yeah, that's probably true.

See also Eliezer's <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Yudkowsky%27s_coming_of_age\">Coming of Age</a> story, SarahC's <a href=\"/lw/50p/reflections_on_rationality_a_year_out/\">Reflections on rationality a year out</a>, and Alicorn's <a href=\"/lw/79x/polyhacking/\">Polyhacking</a>.</small></p>\n<p>On January 11, 2007, at age 21, I finally whispered to myself: <em>There is no God</em>.</p>\n<p>I felt the world collapse beneath me. I'd been raised to believe that God was necessary for meaning, morality, and purpose. My skin felt cold and my tongue felt like cardboard. This was the beginning of the darkest part of my life, but the seed of my later happiness.</p>\n<p>I grew up in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Minnesota\">Cambridge, Minnesota</a> \u2014 a town of 5,000 people and 22 Christian churches (at the time). My father was (and still is) pastor of a small church. My mother volunteered to support Christian missionaries around the world.</p>\n<p>I went to church and Bible study every week. I prayed often and earnestly. For 12 years I attended a Christian school that taught Bible classes and creationism. I played in worship bands. As a teenager I made trips to China and England to tell the godless heathens there about Jesus. I witnessed miraculous healings unexplained by medical science.</p>\n<p>And I <em>felt the presence of God</em>. Sometimes I would tingle and sweat with the Holy Spirit. Other times I felt led by God to give money to a certain cause, or to pay someone a specific compliment, or to walk to the cross at the front of my church and <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=3377\">bow before it during a worship service</a>.</p>\n<p>Around age 19 I got depressed. But then I read Dallas Willard\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Divine-Conspiracy-Rediscovering-Hidden-Life/dp/0060693339/\">The Divine Conspiracy</a></em>, a manual for how to fall in love with God so that following his ways is not a burden but a natural and painless product of loving God. And one day I saw a leaf twirling in the wind and it was so beautiful \u2014 like the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGWU4QhJ4L8\">twirling plastic bag</a> in&nbsp;<em>American Beauty</em> \u2014 that I had an epiphany. I realized that everything in nature was a gift from God to me. Grass, lakes, trees, sunsets \u2014 all these were gifts of beauty from my Savior to me. That's how I fell <em>in love</em>&nbsp;with God,&nbsp;and he delivered me from my depression.</p>\n<p>I moved to Minneapolis for college and was attracted to a Christian group led by <a href=\"http://www.markvans.info/\">Mark van Steenwyk</a>. Mark\u2019s small group of well-educated Jesus-followers are 'missional' Christians: they think that loving and serving others in the way of Jesus is more important than doctrinal truth. That resonated with me, and we lived it out with the poor immigrants of Minneapolis.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Doubt\">Doubt</h4>\n<p>By this time I had little interest in church structure or doctrinal disputes. I just wanted to <em>be like Jesus</em> to a lost and hurting world. So I decided I should try to find out who Jesus actually was. I began to study the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus\">Historical Jesus</a>.</p>\n<p>What I learned, even when reading <em>Christian</em> scholars, <a href=\"http://godtaughtme.wordpress.com/2007/01/10/rediscovering-jesus/\">shocked me</a>. The gospels were written decades after Jesus' death, by non-eyewitnesses. They are riddled with contradictions, legends, and known lies. Jesus and Paul disagreed on many core issues. And how could I accept miracle claims about Jesus when I outright rejected other ancient miracle claims as superstitious nonsense?</p>\n<p>These discoveries scared me. It was not what I had wanted to learn. But now I had to know the truth. I studied the Historical Jesus, the history of Christianity, the Bible, theology, and the philosophy of religion. Almost everything I read \u2014 even the books written by conservative Christians \u2014 gave me <em>more</em> reason to doubt, not less. What preachers had taught me from the pulpit was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=4669\">not what they had learned in seminary</a>. My discovery of the difference had just the effect on me that conservative Bible scholar Daniel B. Wallace <a href=\"http://bible.org/article/gospel-according-bart\">predicted</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The intentional dumbing down of the church for the sake of filling more pews will ultimately lead to defection from Christ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I started to panic. I felt like my best friend \u2014 my source of purpose and happiness and comfort \u2014 was dying. And worse, <em>I was killing him</em>. If only I could have faith! If only I could unlearn all these things and <em>just believe</em>. I cried out with the words from Mark 9:24, \"Lord, help my unbelief!\"</p>\n<p>I tried. For every atheist book I read, I read five books by the very best Christian philosophers. But the atheists made plain, simple sense, and the Christian philosophers were lost in a fog of big words that tried to hide the weakness of their arguments.</p>\n<p>I did everything I could to keep my faith. But I couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t force myself to believe what I knew wasn\u2019t true. So I finally let myself whisper the horrifying truth out loud: <em>There is no God</em>.</p>\n<p>I told my dad, and he said I had been led astray because I was arrogant to think I could get to truth by <em>studying</em>&nbsp;\u2014 I was \"relying too much on my own strength.\"&nbsp;Humbled and encouraged, I started a new quest to find God. I <a href=\"http://godtaughtme.wordpress.com/2007/01/17/short-story/\">wrote</a> on my blog:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve been humbled. I was \u201cdoing discipleship\u201d in my own strength, because I thought I was smart enough and disciplined enough. [Now] having surrendered my prideful and independent ways to him, I can see how my weakness is God\u2019s strength.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve repented. I was deceived because I did not let the Spirit lead me into truth. Now I ask for God\u2019s guidance in all quests for knowledge and wisdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I feel like I\u2019ve been born again, again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It didn\u2019t last. Every time I reached out for some reason \u2014 any reason \u2014 to believe, God simply wasn\u2019t there. I tried to believe despite the evidence, but I couldn\u2019t believe a lie. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>No matter how much I missed him, I couldn\u2019t bring Jesus back to life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"New_Joy_and_Purpose\">New Joy and Purpose</h4>\n<p>Eventually I realized that millions of people have lived lives of incredible meaning, morality, and happiness without gods.&nbsp;I soon realized I could be <em>more</em> happy and moral without God than I ever was <em>with</em> him.</p>\n<p>In many ways, I regret wasting more than 20 years of my life on Christianity, but there are a few things of value I took from my life as an evangelical Christian.&nbsp;I know what it\u2019s like to be a true believer. I know what it\u2019s like to fall in love with God and serve him with all my heart. I know what\u2019s it like to experience his presence.&nbsp;I know what it\u2019s like to isolate one part of my life from reason or evidence, and I know what it\u2019s like to think that is a <em>virtue</em>.&nbsp;I know what it\u2019s like to be confused by the Trinity, the failure of prayers, or Biblical contradictions but to genuinely embrace them as the mystery of God. I know what it\u2019s like to believe God is so far beyond human reason that we can\u2019t understand him, but at the same time to fiercely believe I know the details of how he wants us to <em>behave</em>.</p>\n<p>I can talk to believers with understanding. I've experienced God the same way they have.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more important, I have a <em>visceral knowledge</em>&nbsp;that I can experience something personally, and be confident&nbsp;of it, and be <em>completely wrong</em>&nbsp;about it. I also have a gut understanding of <em>how wonderful it can be to <a href=\"/lw/i9/the_importance_of_saying_oops/\">just say \"oops\" already</a> and change your mind</em>.</p>\n<p>I suspect this is why it was so easy for me, a bit later, to quickly change my mind about free will, about metaethics, about political libertarianism, and about many other things. It was also why I became so interested in the cognitive science of how our beliefs can get so screwy, which eventually led me to Less Wrong, where I finally encountered that <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf\">famous paragraph</a> by I.J. Good:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I remember reading that paragraph and immediately thinking something like: <em>Woah. Umm... yeah... woah. That... yeah, that's probably true. But that's crazy because... that changes fricking <strong>everything</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>So I thought about it for a week, and looked up the counterarguments, and concluded that given my current understanding, an intelligence explosion was nearly inevitable (conditional on a basic continued progress of science) and that everything else I could spend my life working on was trivial by comparison.</p>\n<p>So I mostly stopped <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/\">blogging</a> about philosophy of religion, read through all of Less Wrong, studied more cognitive science and AI, quit my job in L.A., and moved to Berkeley to become a visiting fellow with <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">Singularity Institute</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"The_Level_Above_My_Own\">The Level Above My Own</h4>\n<p>My move to Berkeley was a bit like the common tale of the smartest kid in a small town going to Harvard and finding out that he's no longer the smartest person in the room.

The event will be held October 15 &amp; 16 at 92Y in New York.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;\">The Summit will explore \"big picture\" questions such as the direction of the global economy, philosophy of mind, and the ethics of technological development. Twenty-five speakers will present including two professors of robotics, financial experts, a co-founder of Skype, a pioneer in regenerative medicine, scientists from the MIT Media Lab, a longevity expert, economist Tyler Cowen, cosmologist Max Tegmark, neuroscientist Christof Koch, and venture capitalist Peter Thiel.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;\">The recent victory of IBM's Watson supercomputer on the game show Jeopardy! will be the central theme of discussion, with a keynote by Jeopardy contestant and 74-time winner Ken Jennings.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Jennings surprised audiences around the world in 2004 when he won 74 continuous Jeopardy! matches, winning over $2,500,000 on a six-month streak. In February, Jennings went up against Watson in on a special exhibition match of Jeopardy!, and lost. In his keynote at Singularity Summit, Jennings will recount his experience on Jeopardy! and what it felt like to lose to a machine on the game show he otherwise dominated.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Ray Kurzweil, futurist and inventor, will be speak on the implications of the Watson victory.

href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_and_Philosophy\">Rationality and Philosophy</a></small></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Flesh-Embodied-Challenge-Western/dp/0465056741/\">Philosophy in the Flesh</a></em>, by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, opens with a bang:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The mind is inherently embodied. Thought is mostly unconscious. Abstract concepts are largely metaphorical.</p>\n<p>These are three major findings of cognitive science. More than two millennia of <em>a priori</em> philosophical speculation about these aspects of reason are over. Because of these discoveries, philosophy can never be the same again.</p>\n<p>When taken together and considered in detail, these three findings... are inconsistent with central parts of... analytic philosophy...</p>\n<p>This book asks: What would happen if we started with these empirical discoveries about the nature of mind and constructed philosophy anew?</p>\n<p>...A serious appreciation of cognitive science requires us to rethink philosophy from the beginning, in a way that would put it more in touch with the reality of how we think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what <em>would</em> happen if we dropped all philosophical methods that were developed when we had a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)\">Cartesian</a>&nbsp;view of the mind and of reason, and instead invented philosophy anew given <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=13607\">what we now know</a> about the physical processes that produce human reasoning?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What emerges is a philosophy close to the bone. A philosophical perspective based on our empirical understanding of the embodiment of mind is a philosophy in the flesh, a philosophy that takes account of what we most basically <em>are</em> and <em>can be</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Philosophy is a <a href=\"/lw/4zs/philosophy_a_diseased_discipline/\">diseased discipline</a>, but good philosophy can (and <a href=\"/lw/43v/the_urgent_metaethics_of_friendly_artificial/\">must</a>) be done. I'd like to explore how one can do good philosophy, in part by taking cognitive science seriously.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<h4><br /></h4>\n<h4>Conceptual Analysis</h4>\n<p>Let me begin with a quick, easy example of how cognitive science can inform our philosophical methodology. The example below shouldn&rsquo;t surprise anyone who has read <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/A_Human%27s_Guide_to_Words\">A Human&rsquo;s Guide to Words</a>, but it does illustrate how misguided thousands of philosophical works can be due to an ignorance of cognitive science.</p>\n<p>Consider what may be the central method of 20th century analytic philosophy: <em>conceptual analysis</em>. In its standard form, conceptual analysis assumes (Ramsey 1992) the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/#ClaThe\">classical view</a>&rdquo; of concepts, that a &ldquo;concept <em>C</em> has definitional structure in that it is composed of simpler concepts that express necessary and sufficient conditions for falling under <em>C</em>.&rdquo; For example, the concept <span style=\"&rdquo;font-variant:\">bachelor</span> has the constituents <span style=\"&rdquo;font-variant:\">unmarried</span> and <span style=\"&rdquo;font-variant:\">man</span>. Something falls under the concept <span style=\"&rdquo;font-variant:\">bachelor</span> if and only if it is an unmarried man.</p>\n<p>Conceptual analysis, then, is the attempt to examine our intuitive concepts and arrive at definitions (in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions) that capture the meaning of those concepts. De Paul &amp; Ramsey (1999) explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone familiar with Plato's dialogues knows how [conceptual analysis] is conducted. We see Socrates encounter someone who claims to have figured out the true essence of some abstract notion... the person puts forward a definition or analysis of the notion in the form of necessary and sufficient conditions that are thought to capture all and only instances of the concept in question. Socrates then refutes his interlocutor's definition of the concept by pointing out various counterexamples...</p>\n<p>For example, in Book I of the <em>Republic</em>, when Cephalus defines justice in a way that requires the returning of property and total honesty, Socrates responds by pointing out that it would be unjust to return weapons to a person who had gone mad or to tell the whole truth to such a person.... [The] proposed analysis is rejected because it fails to capture our intuitive judgments about the nature of justice.</p>\n<p>After a proposed analysis or definition is overturned by an intuitive counterexample, the idea is to revise or replace the analysis with one that is not subject to the counterexample. Counterexamples to the new analysis are sought, the analysis revised if any counterexamples are found, and so on...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The practice continues even today. Consider the conceptual analysis of <em>knowledge</em>. For centuries, knowledge was considered by most to be <em>justified true belief</em> (JTB). If Susan believed X but X wasn&rsquo;t true, then Susan couldn&rsquo;t be said to have knowledge of X. Likewise, if X was true but Susan didn&rsquo;t <em>believe</em> X, then she didn&rsquo;t have knowledge of X. And if Susan believed X and X was true but Susan had no justification for believing X, then she didn&rsquo;t really have &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; she just had an accidentally true belief. But if Susan had justified true belief of X, then she <em>did</em> have knowledge of X.</p>\n<p>And then Gettier (1963) offered some famous counterexamples to this analysis of knowledge. Here is a later counterexample, summarized by Zagzebski (1994):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...imagine that you are driving through a region in which, unknown to you, the inhabitants have erected three barn facades for each real barn in an effort to make themselves look more prosperous. Your eyesight is normal and reliable enough in ordinary circumstances to spot a barn from the road. But in this case the fake barns are indistinguishable from the real barns at such a distance. As you look at a real barn you form the belief 'That's a fine barn'. The belief is true and justified, but [intuitively, it isn&rsquo;t knowledge].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As in most counterexamples to the JTB analysis of knowledge, the counterexample to JTB arises due to &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; in the scenario:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is only an accident that visual faculties normally reliable in this sort of situation are not reliable in this particular situation; and it is another accident that you happened to be looking at a real barn and hit on the truth anyway... the [counter-example] arises because an accident of bad luck is cancelled out by an accident of good luck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A cottage industry sprung up around these &ldquo;Gettier problems,&rdquo; with philosophers proposing new sets of necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge, and other philosophers raising counter-examples to them. Weatherson (2003) described this circus as &ldquo;the analysis of knowledge merry-go-round.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>My purpose here is not to examine Gettier problems in particular, but merely to show that the construction of conceptual analyses in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions is <em>mainstream philosophical practice</em>, and has been for a long time.</p>\n<p>Now, let me explain how cognitive science undermines this mainstream philosophical practice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Concepts in the Brain</h4>\n<p>The problem is that the brain doesn&rsquo;t store concepts in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, so philosophers have been using their intuitions to search for something that isn&rsquo;t there. No wonder philosophers have, for over a century, failed to produce a single, successful, non-trivial conceptual analysis (Fodor 1981; Mills 2008).</p>\n<p>How do psychologists know the brain doesn&rsquo;t work this way? Murphy (2002, p. 16) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The groundbreaking work of Eleanor Rosch in the 1970s essentially killed the classical view, so that it is not now the theory of any actual [scientific] researcher...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But before we get to Rosch, let&rsquo;s look at a different experiment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>McCloskey and Glucksberg (1978)... found that when people were asked to make repeated category judgments such as &lsquo;&lsquo;Is an olive a fruit?&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;Is a dog an animal?&rsquo;&rsquo; there was a subset of items that individual subjects changed their minds about. That is, if you said that an olive was a fruit on one day, two weeks later you might give the opposite answer. Naturally, subjects did not do this for cases like &lsquo;&lsquo;Is a dog an animal?&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;Is a rose an animal?&rsquo;&rsquo; But they did change their minds on borderline cases, such as olive-fruit, and curtains-furniture. In fact, for items that were intermediate between clear members and clear nonmembers, McCloskey and Glucksberg&rsquo;s subjects changed their mind 22% of the time. This may be compared to inconsistent decisions of under 3% for the best examples and clear nonmembers... Thus, the changes in subjects&rsquo; decisions do not reflect an overall inconsistency or lack of attention, but a bona fide uncertainty about the borderline members. In short, many concepts are not clear-cut. There are some items that... seem to be &ldquo;kind of&rdquo; members. (Mills 2002, p. 20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Category-membership for concepts in the human brain is not a yes/no affair, as the &ldquo;necessary and sufficient conditions&rdquo; approach of the classical view assumes. Instead, category membership is <em>fuzzy</em>.</p>\n<p>Another problem for the classical view is raised by <em>typicality effects</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think of a fish, any fish. Did you think of something like a trout or a shark, or did you think of an eel or a flounder? Most people would admit to thinking of something like the first: a torpedo-shaped object with small fins, bilaterally symmetrical, which swims in the water by moving its tail from side to side. Eels are much longer, and they slither; flounders are also differently shaped, aren&rsquo;t symmetrical, and move by waving their body in the vertical dimension. Although all of these things are technically fish, they do not all seem to be equally good examples of fish. The <em>typical</em> category members are the good examples &mdash; what you normally think of when you think of the category. The <em>atypical</em> objects are ones that are known to be members but that are unusual in some way... The classical view does not have any way of distinguishing typical and atypical category members. Since all the items in the category have met the definition&rsquo;s criteria, all are category members.</p>\n<p>...The simplest way to demonstrate this phenomenon is simply to ask people to rate items on how typical they think each item is of a category. So, you could give people a list of fish and ask them to rate how typical each one is of the category fish. Rosch (1975) did this task for 10 categories and looked to see how much subjects agreed with one another. She discovered that the reliability of typicality ratings was an extremely high .97 (where 1.0 would be perfect agreement)... In short, people agree that a trout is a typical fish and an eel is an atypical one. (Mills 2002, p. 22)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So people agree that some items are more typical category members than others, but do these typicality effects manifest in normal cognition and behavior?</p>\n<p>Yes, they do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rips, Shoben, and Smith (1973) found that the ease with which people judged category membership depended on typicality. For example, people find it very easy to affirm that a robin is a bird but are much slower to affirm that a chicken (a less typical item) is a bird. This finding has also been found with visual stimuli: Identifying a picture of a chicken as a bird takes longer than identifying a pictured robin (Murphy and Brownell 1985; Smith, Balzano, and Walker 1978). The influence of typicality is not just in identifying items as category members &mdash; it also occurs with the production of items from a category. Battig and Montague (1969) performed a very large norming study in which subjects were given category names, like furniture or precious stone and had to produce examples of these categories. These data are still used today in choosing stimuli for experiments (though they are limited, as a number of common categories were not included). Mervis, Catlin and Rosch (1976) showed that the items that were most often produced in response to the category names were the ones rated as typical (by other subjects). In fact, the average correlation of typicality and production frequency across categories was .63, which is quite high given all the other variables that affect production.</p>\n<p>When people learn artificial categories, they tend to learn the typical items before the atypical ones (Rosch, Simpson, and Miller 1976). Furthermore, learning is faster if subjects are taught on mostly typical items than if they are taught on atypical items (Mervis and Pani 1980; Posner and Keele 1968). Thus, typicality is not just a feeling that people have about some items (&ldquo;trout good; eels bad&rdquo;) &mdash; it is important to the initial learning of the category in a number of respects...</p>\n<p>Learning is not the end of the influence, however. Typical items are more useful for inferences about category members. For example, imagine that you heard that eagles had caught some disease. How likely do you think it would be to spread to other birds? Now suppose that it turned out to be larks or robins who caught the disease. Rips (1975) found that people were more likely to infer that other birds would catch the disease when a typical bird, like robins, had it than when an atypical one, like eagles, had it... (Murphy 2002, p. 23)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(If you want further evidence of typicality effects on cognition, see Murphy [2002] and Hampton [2008].)</p>\n<p>The classical view of concepts, with its binary category membership, cannot explain typicality effects.</p>\n<p>So the classical view of concepts must be rejected, along with any version of conceptual analysis that depends upon it. (If you doubt that many philosophers have done work dependent on the classical view of concepts, see <a href=\"/lw/7tz/philosophy_by_humans_1_concepts_dont_work_that_way/4x17\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>To be fair, quite a few philosophers have now given up on the classical view of concepts and the &ldquo;necessary and sufficient conditions&rdquo; approach to conceptual analysis. And of course there are other reasons that <a href=\"/lw/5u2/pluralistic_moral_reductionism/\">seeking definitions stipulated as necessary and sufficient conditions</a> can be useful. But I wanted to begin with a clear and &ldquo;settled&rdquo; case of how cognitive science can undermine a particular philosophical practice and require that we ask and answer philosophical questions differently.</p>\n<p>Philosophy by humans must respect the cognitive science of how humans reason.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Next post: <a href=\"/lw/8lz/philosophy_by_humans_2_living_metaphorically/\">Living Metaphorically</a></p>\n<p align=\"right\">Previous post: <a href=\"/lw/4vs/when_intuitions_are_useful/\">When Intuitions Are Useful</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>References</h4>\n<p><small>Battig &amp; Montague (1969).

href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Flesh-Embodied-Challenge-Western/dp/0465056741/\">Philosophy in the Flesh</a></em>, by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, opens with a bang:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The mind is inherently embodied. Thought is mostly unconscious. Abstract concepts are largely metaphorical.</p>\n<p>These are three major findings of cognitive science. More than two millennia of <em>a priori</em> philosophical speculation about these aspects of reason are over. Because of these discoveries, philosophy can never be the same again.</p>\n<p>When taken together and considered in detail, these three findings... are inconsistent with central parts of... analytic philosophy...</p>\n<p>This book asks: What would happen if we started with these empirical discoveries about the nature of mind and constructed philosophy anew?</p>\n<p>...A serious appreciation of cognitive science requires us to rethink philosophy from the beginning, in a way that would put it more in touch with the reality of how we think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what <em>would</em> happen if we dropped all philosophical methods that were developed when we had a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)\">Cartesian</a>&nbsp;view of the mind and of reason, and instead invented philosophy anew given <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=13607\">what we now know</a> about the physical processes that produce human reasoning?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What emerges is a philosophy close to the bone. A philosophical perspective based on our empirical understanding of the embodiment of mind is a philosophy in the flesh, a philosophy that takes account of what we most basically <em>are</em> and <em>can be</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Philosophy is a <a href=\"/lw/4zs/philosophy_a_diseased_discipline/\">diseased discipline</a>, but good philosophy can (and <a href=\"/lw/43v/the_urgent_metaethics_of_friendly_artificial/\">must</a>) be done. I'd like to explore how one can do good philosophy, in part by taking cognitive science seriously.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4 id=\"Conceptual_Analysis\">Conceptual Analysis</h4>\n<p>Let me begin with a quick, easy example of how cognitive science can inform our philosophical methodology. The example below shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone who has read <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/A_Human%27s_Guide_to_Words\">A Human\u2019s Guide to Words</a>, but it does illustrate how misguided thousands of philosophical works can be due to an ignorance of cognitive science.</p>\n<p>Consider what may be the central method of 20th century analytic philosophy: <em>conceptual analysis</em>. In its standard form, conceptual analysis assumes (Ramsey 1992) the \u201c<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/#ClaThe\">classical view</a>\u201d of concepts, that a \u201cconcept <em>C</em> has definitional structure in that it is composed of simpler concepts that express necessary and sufficient conditions for falling under <em>C</em>.\u201d For example, the concept <span style=\"\u201dfont-variant:\">bachelor</span> has the constituents <span style=\"\u201dfont-variant:\">unmarried</span> and <span style=\"\u201dfont-variant:\">man</span>. Something falls under the concept <span style=\"\u201dfont-variant:\">bachelor</span> if and only if it is an unmarried man.</p>\n<p>Conceptual analysis, then, is the attempt to examine our intuitive concepts and arrive at definitions (in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions) that capture the meaning of those concepts. De Paul &amp; Ramsey (1999) explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone familiar with Plato's dialogues knows how [conceptual analysis] is conducted. We see Socrates encounter someone who claims to have figured out the true essence of some abstract notion... the person puts forward a definition or analysis of the notion in the form of necessary and sufficient conditions that are thought to capture all and only instances of the concept in question. Socrates then refutes his interlocutor's definition of the concept by pointing out various counterexamples...</p>\n<p>For example, in Book I of the <em>Republic</em>, when Cephalus defines justice in a way that requires the returning of property and total honesty, Socrates responds by pointing out that it would be unjust to return weapons to a person who had gone mad or to tell the whole truth to such a person.... [The] proposed analysis is rejected because it fails to capture our intuitive judgments about the nature of justice.</p>\n<p>After a proposed analysis or definition is overturned by an intuitive counterexample, the idea is to revise or replace the analysis with one that is not subject to the counterexample. Counterexamples to the new analysis are sought, the analysis revised if any counterexamples are found, and so on...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The practice continues even today. Consider the conceptual analysis of <em>knowledge</em>. For centuries, knowledge was considered by most to be <em>justified true belief</em> (JTB). If Susan believed X but X wasn\u2019t true, then Susan couldn\u2019t be said to have knowledge of X. Likewise, if X was true but Susan didn\u2019t <em>believe</em> X, then she didn\u2019t have knowledge of X. And if Susan believed X and X was true but Susan had no justification for believing X, then she didn\u2019t really have \u201cknowledge,\u201d she just had an accidentally true belief. But if Susan had justified true belief of X, then she <em>did</em> have knowledge of X.</p>\n<p>And then Gettier (1963) offered some famous counterexamples to this analysis of knowledge. Here is a later counterexample, summarized by Zagzebski (1994):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...imagine that you are driving through a region in which, unknown to you, the inhabitants have erected three barn facades for each real barn in an effort to make themselves look more prosperous. Your eyesight is normal and reliable enough in ordinary circumstances to spot a barn from the road. But in this case the fake barns are indistinguishable from the real barns at such a distance. As you look at a real barn you form the belief 'That's a fine barn'. The belief is true and justified, but [intuitively, it isn\u2019t knowledge].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As in most counterexamples to the JTB analysis of knowledge, the counterexample to JTB arises due to \u201caccidents\u201d in the scenario:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is only an accident that visual faculties normally reliable in this sort of situation are not reliable in this particular situation; and it is another accident that you happened to be looking at a real barn and hit on the truth anyway... the [counter-example] arises because an accident of bad luck is cancelled out by an accident of good luck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A cottage industry sprung up around these \u201cGettier problems,\u201d with philosophers proposing new sets of necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge, and other philosophers raising counter-examples to them. Weatherson (2003) described this circus as \u201cthe analysis of knowledge merry-go-round.\u201d</p>\n<p>My purpose here is not to examine Gettier problems in particular, but merely to show that the construction of conceptual analyses in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions is <em>mainstream philosophical practice</em>, and has been for a long time.</p>\n<p>Now, let me explain how cognitive science undermines this mainstream philosophical practice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Concepts_in_the_Brain\">Concepts in the Brain</h4>\n<p>The problem is that the brain doesn\u2019t store concepts in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, so philosophers have been using their intuitions to search for something that isn\u2019t there. No wonder philosophers have, for over a century, failed to produce a single, successful, non-trivial conceptual analysis (Fodor 1981; Mills 2008).</p>\n<p>How do psychologists know the brain doesn\u2019t work this way? Murphy (2002, p. 16) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The groundbreaking work of Eleanor Rosch in the 1970s essentially killed the classical view, so that it is not now the theory of any actual [scientific] researcher...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But before we get to Rosch, let\u2019s look at a different experiment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>McCloskey and Glucksberg (1978)... found that when people were asked to make repeated category judgments such as \u2018\u2018Is an olive a fruit?\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Is a dog an animal?\u2019\u2019 there was a subset of items that individual subjects changed their minds about. That is, if you said that an olive was a fruit on one day, two weeks later you might give the opposite answer. Naturally, subjects did not do this for cases like \u2018\u2018Is a dog an animal?\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Is a rose an animal?\u2019\u2019 But they did change their minds on borderline cases, such as olive-fruit, and curtains-furniture. In fact, for items that were intermediate between clear members and clear nonmembers, McCloskey and Glucksberg\u2019s subjects changed their mind 22% of the time. This may be compared to inconsistent decisions of under 3% for the best examples and clear nonmembers... Thus, the changes in subjects\u2019 decisions do not reflect an overall inconsistency or lack of attention, but a bona fide uncertainty about the borderline members. In short, many concepts are not clear-cut. There are some items that... seem to be \u201ckind of\u201d members. (Mills 2002, p. 20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Category-membership for concepts in the human brain is not a yes/no affair, as the \u201cnecessary and sufficient conditions\u201d approach of the classical view assumes. Instead, category membership is <em>fuzzy</em>.</p>\n<p>Another problem for the classical view is raised by <em>typicality effects</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think of a fish, any fish. Did you think of something like a trout or a shark, or did you think of an eel or a flounder? Most people would admit to thinking of something like the first: a torpedo-shaped object with small fins, bilaterally symmetrical, which swims in the water by moving its tail from side to side. Eels are much longer, and they slither; flounders are also differently shaped, aren\u2019t symmetrical, and move by waving their body in the vertical dimension. Although all of these things are technically fish, they do not all seem to be equally good examples of fish. The <em>typical</em> category members are the good examples \u2014 what you normally think of when you think of the category. The <em>atypical</em> objects are ones that are known to be members but that are unusual in some way... The classical view does not have any way of distinguishing typical and atypical category members. Since all the items in the category have met the definition\u2019s criteria, all are category members.</p>\n<p>...The simplest way to demonstrate this phenomenon is simply to ask people to rate items on how typical they think each item is of a category. So, you could give people a list of fish and ask them to rate how typical each one is of the category fish. Rosch (1975) did this task for 10 categories and looked to see how much subjects agreed with one another. She discovered that the reliability of typicality ratings was an extremely high .97 (where 1.0 would be perfect agreement)... In short, people agree that a trout is a typical fish and an eel is an atypical one. (Mills 2002, p. 22)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So people agree that some items are more typical category members than others, but do these typicality effects manifest in normal cognition and behavior?</p>\n<p>Yes, they do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rips, Shoben, and Smith (1973) found that the ease with which people judged category membership depended on typicality. For example, people find it very easy to affirm that a robin is a bird but are much slower to affirm that a chicken (a less typical item) is a bird. This finding has also been found with visual stimuli: Identifying a picture of a chicken as a bird takes longer than identifying a pictured robin (Murphy and Brownell 1985; Smith, Balzano, and Walker 1978). The influence of typicality is not just in identifying items as category members \u2014 it also occurs with the production of items from a category. Battig and Montague (1969) performed a very large norming study in which subjects were given category names, like furniture or precious stone and had to produce examples of these categories. These data are still used today in choosing stimuli for experiments (though they are limited, as a number of common categories were not included). Mervis, Catlin and Rosch (1976) showed that the items that were most often produced in response to the category names were the ones rated as typical (by other subjects). In fact, the average correlation of typicality and production frequency across categories was .63, which is quite high given all the other variables that affect production.</p>\n<p>When people learn artificial categories, they tend to learn the typical items before the atypical ones (Rosch, Simpson, and Miller 1976). Furthermore, learning is faster if subjects are taught on mostly typical items than if they are taught on atypical items (Mervis and Pani 1980; Posner and Keele 1968). Thus, typicality is not just a feeling that people have about some items (\u201ctrout good; eels bad\u201d) \u2014 it is important to the initial learning of the category in a number of respects...</p>\n<p>Learning is not the end of the influence, however. Typical items are more useful for inferences about category members. For example, imagine that you heard that eagles had caught some disease. How likely do you think it would be to spread to other birds? Now suppose that it turned out to be larks or robins who caught the disease. Rips (1975) found that people were more likely to infer that other birds would catch the disease when a typical bird, like robins, had it than when an atypical one, like eagles, had it... (Murphy 2002, p. 23)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(If you want further evidence of typicality effects on cognition, see Murphy [2002] and Hampton [2008].)</p>\n<p>The classical view of concepts, with its binary category membership, cannot explain typicality effects.</p>\n<p>So the classical view of concepts must be rejected, along with any version of conceptual analysis that depends upon it. (If you doubt that many philosophers have done work dependent on the classical view of concepts, see <a href=\"/lw/7tz/philosophy_by_humans_1_concepts_dont_work_that_way/4x17\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>To be fair, quite a few philosophers have now given up on the classical view of concepts and the \u201cnecessary and sufficient conditions\u201d approach to conceptual analysis. And of course there are other reasons that <a href=\"/lw/5u2/pluralistic_moral_reductionism/\">seeking definitions stipulated as necessary and sufficient conditions</a> can be useful. But I wanted to begin with a clear and \u201csettled\u201d case of how cognitive science can undermine a particular philosophical practice and require that we ask and answer philosophical questions differently.</p>\n<p>Philosophy by humans must respect the cognitive science of how humans reason.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Next post: <a href=\"/lw/8lz/philosophy_by_humans_2_living_metaphorically/\">Living Metaphorically</a></p>\n<p align=\"right\">Previous post: <a href=\"/lw/4vs/when_intuitions_are_useful/\">When Intuitions Are Useful</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"References\">References</h4>\n<p><small>Battig &amp; Montague (1969).

This format allows quotations to be evaluated with less context available, with all that entails. I hope this allays some of the uncertainty regarding why words of the Bible or authors such as Nietzsche are sometimes poorly received. People are encouraged to vote without considering the source information. If locally idolized people said genuinely silly things even considering the context, feel free to post those as well, but please use your best judgement as to whether or not taking it out of context is fair to the speaker.</p>\n<p>Please use your own judgement in deciding which quotes thread to post material. This isn't intended to compete with the main thread, it's an experiment to see if people like a different format better. Some people thought this format, or something like it, should simply be tried on the next regular quotes thread to minimize any disruption caused by having multiple threads, while others thought disruption wold be minimized by having a separate thread and leaving the main thread as normal. This is what I decided to do.</p>\n<p>The usual rules apply, except that there is no fixed limit to the number of quotes one may submit, because I'd like to populate this thread without taking too much from the usual thread.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;\"> </span></p>\n<ul style=\"padding: 0px;\">\n<li>Please post all quotes separately, so that they can be voted up/down separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;(If they are strongly related, reply to your own comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;If strongly ordered, then go ahead and post them together.)</li>\n<li>Do not quote yourself.</li>\n<li>Do not quote comments/posts on LW/OB.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null,

So even if you have truly and correctly identified a cluster of people who believe X for very bad, no good, awful, non-virtuous reasons, one does not properly conclude not-X, but rather calls it all not-evidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think the statement makes a correct point - don't dismiss an idea just because a few proponents are stupid - but is too strong as written. In some cases, we <em>can</em> derive information about the truth of a proposition by psychoanalyzing reasons for believing it.</p>\n<p>There are certain propositions that people are likely to assert regardless of whether or not they are true. Maybe they're useful for status disputes, or part of a community membership test, or just synchronize well with particula human biases. \"X proves the existence of God\" commonly gets asserted whether or not X actually proves the existence of God. Anything that supports one race, gender, political party, or ideology over another is also suspect. Let's call these sorts of propositions \"popular claims\". Some true propositions might be popular claims, but popular claims are popular whether or not they are true.</p>\n<p>Some popular claims are surprising. Without knowing anything about modern society, one might not <em>predict </em>that diluting chemicals thousands of times to cure diseases, or claiming the government is hiding alien bodies, would be common failure modes. You don't know these are popular claims until you hear them.</p>\n<p>If a very large group of people make a certain assertion, and you always find it to be false, you now have very good evidence that it's a popular claim, a proposition that people will very often assert even if it's false.</p>\n<p>Normally, when someone asserts a proposition, you assume they have good evidence for it - in Bayesian terms, the probability that they would assert it is higher if there is evidence than if there is not evidence. But people assert popular claims very often even when there is no evidence for them, so someone asserting a popular claim provides no (or little) evidence for it, leaving you back at whatever its prior is.</p>\n<p>Time for an example: suppose two respected archaeologists (who happen to be Mormon) publish two papers on the same day. The first archaeologist claims to have found evidence that Native Americans are descended from ancient Israelites. The second archaeologist claims to have found evidence that Zulus are descended from Australian aborigines.</p>\n<p>On the face of it, these two claims are about equally crazy-sounding. But I would be much more likely to pay attention to the claim that the Zulus are descended from aborigines. I know that the Mormons have a bias in favor of believing Indians are descended from Israelites, and probably whatever new evidence the archaeologist thinks she's found was just motivated by this same bias. But <em>no one</em> believes Zulus are descended from Australians. If someone claims they are, she must have some new and interesting reason to think so.</p>\n<p>(to put it another way, we expect a Mormon to privilege the hypothesis of Israelite descent; her religion has already picked it out of hypothesis-space. We don't expect a Mormon to privilege the hypothesis of Australian descent, so it's more likely that she came to it honestly).</p>\n<p>If then I were to learn that there was a large community of Mormons who interpreted their scripture to say that Zulus were descended from Australians, I would consider it much more likely that the second archaeologist was also just parroting a religious bias, and I would no longer be quite as interested in reading her paper.</p>\n<p>In this case, reversed stupidity <em>is</em> intelligence - learning that many people believed in an Australian-Zulu connection for religious reasons decreases my probability that the posited Australian-Zulu connection is real. I can never go lower than my whatever my prior for an Australian - Zulu connection would be, but I can discount a lot of the evidence that might otherwise take me above my prior.</p>\n<p>So in summary, a proposition asserted for stupid reasons can raise your probability that it is the sort of proposition that people assert for stupid reasons, which in turn can lower your probability that the next person to assert it will have smart reasons for doing so. Reversed stupidity can never bring the probability of an idea lower than its prior, but it can help you discount evidence that would otherwise bring it higher.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true,

href=\"/lw/6mi/some_thoughts_on_singularity_strategies/\">argued</a>&nbsp;that instead of working on FAI, a better strategy is to pursue an upload or IA based Singularity. In response to this, some argue that we still need to work on FAI/CEV, because what if it turns out that seed AI is much easier than brain emulation or intelligence amplification, and we can't stop or sufficiently delay others from building them? If we had a solution to CEV, we could rush to build a seed AI ourselves, or convince others to make use of the ideas.</p>\n<p>But CEV seems a terrible backup plan for this contingency, since it involves lots of hard philosophical and implementation problems and therefore is likely to arrive too late if seed AI turns out to be easy. (Searching for whether Eliezer or someone else addressed the issue of implementation problems before, I found just a couple of sentences, in the original CEV document: \"The task of construing a satisfactory initial dynamic is not so impossible as it seems. The satisfactory initial dynamic can be coded and tinkered with over years, and may improve itself in obvious and straightforward ways before taking on the task of rewriting itself entirely.\" Which does not make any sense to me&mdash;why can't every other AGI builder make the same argument, that their code can be \"tinkered with\" over many years, and therefore is safe? Why aren't we risking the \"initial dynamic\" FOOMing while it's being tinkered with? Actually, it seems to me that an AI cannot begin to extrapolate anyone's volition until it's already more powerful than a human, so I have no idea how the tinkering is supposed to work at all.)</p>\n<p>So, granting that \"seed AI is much easier than brain emulation or intelligence amplification\" is a very real possibility, I think we need better backup plans. This post is a bit similar to&nbsp;<a href=\"/lw/4t8/the_friendly_ai_game/\">The Friendly AI Game</a>, in that I'm asking for a utility function for a seed AI, but the goal here is not necessarily to build an FAI directly, but to somehow make an eventual positive Singularity more likely, while keeping the utility function simple enough that there's a good chance it can be specified and implemented correctly within a relatively short amount of time. Also, the <a href=\"/lw/4t8/the_friendly_ai_game/3oz4\">top entry</a> in that post is an AI that can answer formally specified questions with minimal side effects, apparently with the idea that we can use such an AI to advance many kinds of science and technology. But I agree with <a href=\"/lw/3lf/asking_precise_questions/3a24\">Nesov</a>&mdash;such an AI doesn't help, if the goal is an eventual positive Singularity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; background-color: #f7f7f8; \">We can do lots of useful things, sure (this is not a point where we disagree), but they don't add up towards \"saving the world\". These are just short-term benefits. Technological progress makes it easier to screw stuff up irrecoverably, advanced tech is the enemy. One shouldn't generally advance the tech if distant end-of-the-world is considered important as compared to immediate benefits [...]</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To give an idea of the kind of \"backup plan\" I have in mind, one idea I've been playing with is to have the seed AI make multiple simulations of the entire Earth (i.e., with different \"random seeds\"), for several years or decades into the future, and have a team of humans pick the best outcome to be released into the real world. (I say \"best outcome\" but many of the outcomes will probably be incomprehensible or dangerous to directly observe, so they should mostly judge the processes that lead to the outcomes instead of the outcomes themselves.) This is still quite complex if you think about how to turn this \"wish\" into a utility function, and lots of things could still go wrong, but to me it seems at least the kind of problem that a team of human researchers/programmers can potentially solve within the relevant time frame.</p>\n<p>Do others have any ideas in this vein?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I've written this essay about the effects of religion. I plan to post it in the main section. However, in my year or so of lurking here I've noticed that most of the first main posts people create are either irrelevant or bad, and end up down voting the poster to oblivion. To this aim, I first post it here, for your critique, and also to tell me if you think it's appropriate to post in the main section of LessWrong.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The effects of religion</strong></p>\n<p>In the atheist community, it's held as pretty much a self-proving truth thar religion is a bad thing. I have attempted to produce a taxonomy of the effects of religion, both positive and negative. This is written based on my personal experience of the Christian church, and on whatever actual facts I could find.</p>\n<p>So. My list of the external effects of religion. These are given as both comparisons to normal people, who don't think much about religion or effective charity, and comparisons to LessWrongians.</p>\n<p>It's worth pointing out that western society seems to have a lot of cached thoughts from Christianity. Normal people are often not Christian, but casually believe a lot of its teachings. As a result, many of the negative effects of Christianity affect non-Christians who don't pay particular attention to their beliefs too.</p>\n<p><br />The purpose of this essay is to determine if LessWrong should actively evangelize against religion. If we really wanted to, we could probably do so fairly easily. I conclude that it's probably not worthwhile doing so.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Charitable giving</strong></p>\n<p>The Christians I know all seem to give far more to charity, both in terms of money and time, than average people. Eliezer pointed this out somewhere, but I can't seem to find a reference. The giving probably isn't quite optimized, but it's a far cry better than nothing. A large proportion of the charity which the Christians I know support seems highly effective, and very little of it is optimized for evangelism alone.</p>\n<p>It could be that by co-incidence I just happen to know particularly effective Christians for some reason.</p>\n<p>It's worth considering the degree to which Christians and atheists disagree on what charities are worth supporting. The only things Christians support which atheists wouldn't as much are things like school chaplains, giving Bibles, and protesting for various Christian issues like opposing gay marriage and abortion. Ridiculous amounts are certainly spent on pointless lobbying, but as a proportion of total Christian charity giving, it can't be that massive.</p>\n<p>I don't think there are any atheist organizations which provide enough peer pressure to have the members give as much, and I don't think many people would be as generous over the long term alone as compared to in church groups. So it's an open question to me as to whether your average LessWrongian would do more or less good via charity than your average Christian.</p>\n<p>Aside from this, I think many Christians are fairly good at making an effort to be casually kind to those around them: at the very least they aren't as casually cruel as normal people can be. I expect that LessWrongians would be about as good as Christians at this.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Time and money spent on religion</strong></p>\n<p>Religious people spend time and money on religious materials, prayer, churches, and so on. The effect of this is probably neutral compared to what a normal person would be doing, as prayer, theology books and such seem to be fairly ineffective but probably not downright negative things. Again, I don't really know what normal people do with their time, but I don't guess that it would be any worse than anything religious. However, this is something which LessWrongians would surely do better at, as they could hopefully spend their time learning useful things or hopefully entertaining themselves in some more meaningful or effective ways.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>No cryonics, attitude to death</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>One of the most important messages I've gotten out of Less Wrong and similar sources is that death is bad. However, religious people disagree, as a result of their belief in an afterlife. I don't know how much this actually matters. Religious people are highly unlikely to sign up for cryonics. However, according to the survey, more LessWrongians are theist than have signed up for cryonics, so I don't think this effect matters much.</p>\n<p>For some bizarre reason, all the issues like abortion, the death penalty, bombing civilians in Arab countries, and euthanasia, where belief in a Christian afterlife would seem to me to encourage a left-leaning viewpoint, are also issues where the western church leans to the right. (For example, I'm not quite sure why anyone who believed in hell for nonbelievers would support war against Muslims.) So all these issues where you'd think their&nbsp;religious beliefs would throw them off, it seems more like their conservatism screws up their reasoning. Correlation not causation.</p>\n<p>I would also expect most theists to value their own lives, and those of people in their religion, far less highly than those of people with different or no religions. This would be a minor problem, however it doesn't seem to come up at all in the real world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Practice and or condoning of irrationality</strong></p>\n<p>Practicing things like faith, believing in things you have little evidence for, and the above being perceived as a sign of virtue is bad for rationality in other areas of your life. In this section I'm not talking about actual incorrect statements made by the religion. There's nothing in Christianity that explicitly says that, for example, wishing for things and believing you'll get them means that you will. However, Christian thinking implicitly gets your mind used to a world with meaning, sense, and your belief as a determining factor.</p>\n<p>In particular, the mind projection fallacy is encouraged by religion. When you believe that there is an omniscient being who controls life, you're encouraged to see patterns where there are none, and see God's character in random events. This is bad.<br />Also, the central thesis of reductionism, that everything is comprised of ontologically simple elements, is contradicted by religion.<br />In Christianity at least, you're told that you need sufficient faith in order to successfully pray. This causes lots of rationality based problems. It's one of the axioms of LessWrong-style rationality that what you think does not affect the world. If you're religious, you don't believe that. It leads to things like \"believing as hard as you can\" and such.</p>\n<p>Finally, religion encourages the just world hypothesis, as a result of belief in a benevolent creator. In Christianity, you can always say \"But God made it that way\" if you support something. This isn't encouraged by the Bible at all, but people still do it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Actual factual errors in the religion</strong></p>\n<p>Obviously, people who believe in a revealed religion are going to walk around wrong about a lot of factual matters. So how many of these actually matter? Things like the power of prayer probably don't matter,as all the Christians I've ever met seem to consume medicine and make health decisions just like the next person.</p>\n<p>Believing in creation has a few effects. Firstly, it encourages people to believe that we are well designed. This makes them less likely to accept the idea of cognitive biases. It makes them skeptical of evolutionary psychology, which is bad.</p>\n<p>People may get some silly moral ideas, like opposition to homosexuality. But this is decreasing in prevalence, for example as shown by the existence of Christian support for gay marriage and abortion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Deontology</strong></p>\n<p>Consequentialism is pretty much common sense. However, most religions are phrased in terms of deontology. (This is actually a problem that Christianity doesn't need to have: Paul's comment \"Everything is permissible, but not everything I'd beneficial\" seems to be as clearly in favor of consequentialism as you're likely to get. Nevertheless, very few Christians seem to get this.) This frequently results in stupid beliefs, like a support of the death penalty, and things such as drug use being \"just wrong\". However, most normal people seem to default to deontology anyways, so it's hard to say that religion directly causes this problem.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Social pressures</strong></p>\n<p>Most Christians would be upset by how frankly LessWrong calls them idiots. As a result, they don't get many of the positive benefits of reading LW type materials. More generally, religious people are going to dislike and mistrust science to a greater extent. There's a lot of benefit to be gained by understanding and trusting science, for example with issues such as climate change.</p>\n<p>They're also going to be discouraged from hanging around the intellectual types of people who are otherwise good for you. If you only read Christian media, you're exposed to a far lesser range of media, and you're more susceptible to the general conservative bias which pervades Christianity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The effect of religious community</strong></p>\n<p>Many studies have shown that religiosity correlates with happiness and health. LessWrong seems to have a general consensus that this is as a result of the community created by a religion. Compared to the default position of a normal person, it's way better to be a churchgoer. It remains to be seen if LessWrong groups can be this effective, even though cases such as the New York Less Wrong group seem to be working fairly nicely from what I've heard.</p>\n<p>Established religions have an extreme advantage over new organizations such as LessWrong chapters. To start with, they are already large and powerful. There aren't many places where there are enough rationalists to start something like the New York Less Wrong group (notice it's in New York). The people who are drawn to LessWrong are possibly the wrong demographic proportions to create lasting communities, particularly with an excess of young males. It's been previously pointed out that getting girls to show up is essential for LessWrong meetups and communities. So it's hard to get rationalist communities going which can rival religious communities' consistency.</p>\n<p>There aren't many organizations like the general Christian church, which provide such a wide ranging base of peer support.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Religion seems to have a variety of positive and negative effects. Its most positive effects are encouraging charity and providing a stable community. The most negative effects are a general mistrust of science, and the various irrationalities which are applauded by religion.</p>\n<p>And so, what should a LessWrongian do with respect to religious people? I think we should be polite to them. Religion doesn't have a bad enough effect to justify arguing against it. If by some chance you do convince them out of their faith, the chance that they won't just default to normal person mode and keep the cached thoughts of their religion is fairly low.</p>\n<p>Additionally, by arguing with religious people, you make them distrust science and intellectuals and rationality. This is significantly more of a problem than the religion itself. Because of \"arguments as soldiers\" the religious person might start always looking out for cases of science being wrong, and also never listen to it, because if you listen to science, you're betraying your faith. This is very, very bad, far worse than just compartmentalizing your beliefs.</p>\n<p>I recommend a policy of \"raising the sanity waterline\". Just casually improving everyone's rationality would be a far more effective goal.&nbsp;It doesn't look like being religious significantly affects your mental abilities in other fields: look at the proportion of religious Nobel prize winners.</p>\n<p>There's little upside in specifically attempting to evangelize theists, so I suggest we shouldn't.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": null, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {"NSMKfa8emSbGNXRKD": 2}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "y3X922SJHLSYNt8BW", "schemaVersion": 1, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "bigUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 18, "baseScore": -3, "extendedScore": null, "score": -5e-06, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "10181", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": -2, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": {"html": "<p><span style=\"color: #2a2a2a; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\"> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I've written this essay about the effects of religion.

However, according to the survey, more LessWrongians are theist than have signed up for cryonics, so I don't think this effect matters much.</p>\n<p>For some bizarre reason, all the issues like abortion, the death penalty, bombing civilians in Arab countries, and euthanasia, where belief in a Christian afterlife would seem to me to encourage a left-leaning viewpoint, are also issues where the western church leans to the right. (For example, I'm not quite sure why anyone who believed in hell for nonbelievers would support war against Muslims.) So all these issues where you'd think their&nbsp;religious beliefs would throw them off, it seems more like their conservatism screws up their reasoning. Correlation not causation.</p>\n<p>I would also expect most theists to value their own lives, and those of people in their religion, far less highly than those of people with different or no religions. This would be a minor problem, however it doesn't seem to come up at all in the real world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Practice_and_or_condoning_of_irrationality\">Practice and or condoning of irrationality</strong></p>\n<p>Practicing things like faith, believing in things you have little evidence for, and the above being perceived as a sign of virtue is bad for rationality in other areas of your life. In this section I'm not talking about actual incorrect statements made by the religion. There's nothing in Christianity that explicitly says that, for example, wishing for things and believing you'll get them means that you will. However, Christian thinking implicitly gets your mind used to a world with meaning, sense, and your belief as a determining factor.</p>\n<p>In particular, the mind projection fallacy is encouraged by religion. When you believe that there is an omniscient being who controls life, you're encouraged to see patterns where there are none, and see God's character in random events. This is bad.<br>Also, the central thesis of reductionism, that everything is comprised of ontologically simple elements, is contradicted by religion.<br>In Christianity at least, you're told that you need sufficient faith in order to successfully pray. This causes lots of rationality based problems. It's one of the axioms of LessWrong-style rationality that what you think does not affect the world. If you're religious, you don't believe that. It leads to things like \"believing as hard as you can\" and such.</p>\n<p>Finally, religion encourages the just world hypothesis, as a result of belief in a benevolent creator. In Christianity, you can always say \"But God made it that way\" if you support something. This isn't encouraged by the Bible at all, but people still do it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Actual_factual_errors_in_the_religion\">Actual factual errors in the religion</strong></p>\n<p>Obviously, people who believe in a revealed religion are going to walk around wrong about a lot of factual matters. So how many of these actually matter? Things like the power of prayer probably don't matter,as all the Christians I've ever met seem to consume medicine and make health decisions just like the next person.</p>\n<p>Believing in creation has a few effects. Firstly, it encourages people to believe that we are well designed. This makes them less likely to accept the idea of cognitive biases. It makes them skeptical of evolutionary psychology, which is bad.</p>\n<p>People may get some silly moral ideas, like opposition to homosexuality. But this is decreasing in prevalence, for example as shown by the existence of Christian support for gay marriage and abortion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Deontology\">Deontology</strong></p>\n<p>Consequentialism is pretty much common sense. However, most religions are phrased in terms of deontology. (This is actually a problem that Christianity doesn't need to have: Paul's comment \"Everything is permissible, but not everything I'd beneficial\" seems to be as clearly in favor of consequentialism as you're likely to get. Nevertheless, very few Christians seem to get this.) This frequently results in stupid beliefs, like a support of the death penalty, and things such as drug use being \"just wrong\". However, most normal people seem to default to deontology anyways, so it's hard to say that religion directly causes this problem.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Social_pressures\">Social pressures</strong></p>\n<p>Most Christians would be upset by how frankly LessWrong calls them idiots. As a result, they don't get many of the positive benefits of reading LW type materials. More generally, religious people are going to dislike and mistrust science to a greater extent. There's a lot of benefit to be gained by understanding and trusting science, for example with issues such as climate change.</p>\n<p>They're also going to be discouraged from hanging around the intellectual types of people who are otherwise good for you. If you only read Christian media, you're exposed to a far lesser range of media, and you're more susceptible to the general conservative bias which pervades Christianity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"The_effect_of_religious_community\">The effect of religious community</strong></p>\n<p>Many studies have shown that religiosity correlates with happiness and health. LessWrong seems to have a general consensus that this is as a result of the community created by a religion. Compared to the default position of a normal person, it's way better to be a churchgoer. It remains to be seen if LessWrong groups can be this effective, even though cases such as the New York Less Wrong group seem to be working fairly nicely from what I've heard.</p>\n<p>Established religions have an extreme advantage over new organizations such as LessWrong chapters. To start with, they are already large and powerful. There aren't many places where there are enough rationalists to start something like the New York Less Wrong group (notice it's in New York). The people who are drawn to LessWrong are possibly the wrong demographic proportions to create lasting communities, particularly with an excess of young males. It's been previously pointed out that getting girls to show up is essential for LessWrong meetups and communities. So it's hard to get rationalist communities going which can rival religious communities' consistency.</p>\n<p>There aren't many organizations like the general Christian church, which provide such a wide ranging base of peer support.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Religion seems to have a variety of positive and negative effects. Its most positive effects are encouraging charity and providing a stable community. The most negative effects are a general mistrust of science, and the various irrationalities which are applauded by religion.</p>\n<p>And so, what should a LessWrongian do with respect to religious people? I think we should be polite to them. Religion doesn't have a bad enough effect to justify arguing against it. If by some chance you do convince them out of their faith, the chance that they won't just default to normal person mode and keep the cached thoughts of their religion is fairly low.</p>\n<p>Additionally, by arguing with religious people, you make them distrust science and intellectuals and rationality. This is significantly more of a problem than the religion itself. Because of \"arguments as soldiers\" the religious person might start always looking out for cases of science being wrong, and also never listen to it, because if you listen to science, you're betraying your faith. This is very, very bad, far worse than just compartmentalizing your beliefs.</p>\n<p>I recommend a policy of \"raising the sanity waterline\". Just casually improving everyone's rationality would be a far more effective goal.&nbsp;It doesn't look like being religious significantly affects your mental abilities in other fields: look at the proportion of religious Nobel prize winners.</p>\n<p>There's little upside in specifically attempting to evangelize theists, so I suggest we shouldn't.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "sections":

Synapse is a turn based strategy combat game that appears to be particularly interesting from a rationalist standpoint. I haven't played it, but according to the <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/06/15/frozen-synapse-review/\">review</a>s, it's actually a combination of turn-based and real-time play. Each turn encompasses 5 seconds of realtime, but that 5 seconds of realtime doesn't happen until both players have constructed their moves, which they may take as long as they'd like to do. Constructing a move involves giving your several units and your opponent's several units commands, watching what happens when the units play out those commands, and repeating that process until one has a set of commands for one's units that one considers optimal given what one predicts one's opponent will do. This happens on a procedurally-generated battlefield; there are reports of this occasionally giving one player or the other an insurmountable advantage, but the reviews seem to indicate that being able to play on a fresh field each time and having to think about proper use of its layout on the fly outweighs this issue.</p>\n<p>Also, the game came to my attention because there's a <a href=\"http://www.humblebundle.com/\">Humble Bundle</a> available for it now, which means that it can be acquired very nearly for free; just ignore the 'beat the average to get more games' hook.</p>",

evidence can undermine belief in an outcome</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Defying logic, people given weak evidence can regard predictions supported by that evidence as less likely than if they aren&rsquo;t given the evidence at all.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Consider the following statement: &ldquo;Widespread use of hybrid and electric cars could reduce worldwide carbon emissions. One bill that has passed the Senate provides a $250 tax credit for purchasing a hybrid or electric car. How likely is it that at least one-fifth of the U.S. car fleet will be hybrid or electric in 2025?&rdquo;<br /><br />That middle sentence is the weak evidence. People presented with the entire statement &mdash; or similar statements with the same three-sentence structure but on different topics &mdash; answered the final question lower than people who read the statement without the middle sentence. They did so even though other people who saw the middle statement in isolation rated it as positive evidence for, in this case, higher adoption of hybrid and electric cars.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Paper: <a title=\"When good evidence goes bad: The weak evidence effect in judgment and decision-making\" href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/philfernbachswebpage/attachments/fernbach_cognition_2011.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">When good evidence goes bad: The weak evidence effect in judgment and decision-making</a></p>\n<p>Abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An indispensable principle of rational thought is that positive evidence should increase<br />belief. In this paper, we demonstrate that people routinely violate this principle when pre-<br />dicting an outcome from a weak cause. In Experiment 1 participants given weak positive<br />evidence judged outcomes of public policy initiatives to be less likely than participants<br />given no evidence, even though the evidence was separately judged to be supportive.<br />Experiment 2 ruled out a pragmatic explanation of the result, that the weak evidence<br />implies the absence of stronger evidence. In Experiment 3, weak positive evidence made<br />people less likely to gamble on the outcome of the 2010 United States mid-term Congres-<br />sional election. Experiments 4 and 5 replicated these findings with everyday causal<br />scenarios. We argue that this &lsquo;&lsquo;weak evidence effect&rsquo;&rsquo; arises because people focus dispro-<br />portionately on the mentioned weak cause and fail to think about alternative causes.</p>\n</blockquote>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null,

href=\"http://www.xuenay.net/Papers/CoalescingMinds.pdf\">http://www.xuenay.net/Papers/CoalescingMinds.pdf</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: We present a hypothetical process of mind coalescence, where artificial connections are created between two brains. This might simply allow for an improved form of communication. At the other extreme, it might merge two minds into one in a process that can be thought of as a reverse split-brain operation. We propose that one way mind coalescence might happen is via an exocortex, a prosthetic extension of the biological brain which integrates with the brain as seamlessly as parts of the biological brain integrate with each other. An exocortex may also prove to be the easiest route for mind uploading, as a person&rsquo;s personality gradually moves from away from the aging biological brain and onto the exocortex. Memories might also be copied and shared even without minds being permanently merged. Over time, the borders of personal identity may become loose or even unnecessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like my <a href=\"/lw/70p/paper_draft_relative_advantages_of_uploads/\">other draft</a>, this is for the special issue on mind uploading in the <em>International Journal of Machine Consciousness</em>. The deadline is Oct 1st, so any comments will have to be quick for me to take them into account.</p>\n<p>This one is co-authored with <a href=\"http://users.ics.tkk.fi/harri/\">Harri Valpola</a>.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Improved paper on the basis of feedback; see <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/7ve/paper_draft_coalescing_minds_brain/4xfy\">this comment</a> for the changelog.</p>",

I can think of two: One is the belief that the behaviour of living things was explained by the mysterious force of elan vital, and not by mere chemistry; which was destroyed by the synthetisation of urea. The other is the special (and mysterious) role of the conscious observer in quantum mechanics, which was explained away by demonstrating that rocks can get entangled with electrons just as much as brains can. Can anyone furnish me with other examples?</p>\n<p>I observe in passing that phlogiston is *not* such a mysterious answer. Eliezer is down on it, but I think unjustly so; for people did in fact perform experiments on phlogiston, including the final experiment to find the weight of the phlogiston that had passed out of the burning material and into the byproducts. It turned out that the phlogiston had negative mass... in other words, that the direction of the transfer had been misidentified. But if you think of phlogiston as `negative oxygen', it makes the same predictions as modern chemical theory. This is no worse a mistake than mistaking the direction of the current, a mistake which is *still* enshrined in our sign conventions; it is not a mysterious answer of the form \"X-&gt;Y\" with no details of X given and any value allowed for Y.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, I digress.

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter\">Great Filter</a> is behind us or in front of us. This relates to the Drake Equation and similar attempts to estimate the frequency of life in an obvious way.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, it has become increasingly apparent that extrasolar planets are common. However, what fraction of these planets lie in their stars habitable zone has still been an open question, primarily because most of our current methods for planet finding easily find planets that are either very large or are very close to their star (ideally both).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A new study, using the data from the Kepler spacecraft, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1109/1109.4682v1.pdf\">estimates that about a third of all stars similar to the sun have at least one planet in the habitable zone.</a>&nbsp;There are some issues with this estimate, and <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/09/29/new-study-13-of-sun-like-stars-might-have-terrestrial-planets-in-their-habitable-zones/\">Phil Plait discusses them at his blog.</a>&nbsp; The estimate has a large amount of variance. The paper actually estimates 34% +/- 14% and the issues that Phil brings up increases the uncertainty in both directions but it seems safe at this point to consider this not being very far off.</p>\n<p>One obvious issue from a Fermi perspective is that some systems will likely have multiple planets in this zone. Also, having planets in the habitable zone is clearly not sufficient for life. By the standard estimates for habitable zones, Venus and Mars are both in the habitable zone of the sun. And there may very well be ways for life to arise outside the habitable zone. Moons like Europa and Titan seem to be excellent candidates, and we can't rule out more exotic forms of life in other habitats although that seems not too likely right now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, one thing this makes clear: The part of the Great Filter that is behind us that is due to planets not &nbsp;lying inside the habitable zone is small. So the question is, what does this mean for our estimates of how much of the Filter is behind us and how much is in front of us?&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

padding: 10px;\" src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pill-man.png\" alt=\"\" />Can drugs improve your rationality?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but it seems likely.</p>\n<p>Remember <a href=\"/lw/7e5/the_cognitive_science_of_rationality/\">the cognitive science of rationality</a>. Often, irrationality is a result of &lsquo;mindware gaps&rsquo; or &lsquo;contaminated mindware&rsquo; &mdash; missing pieces of knowledge like probability theory, or wrong ideas like supernaturalism. Alas, we cannot yet put probability theory in a pill and feed it to people, nor can a pill deprogram someone from supernaturalism.</p>\n<p>Another cause of irrationality is &lsquo;cognitive miserliness&rsquo;. We default to automatic, unconscious, inaccurate processes whenever possible. Even if we manage to override those processes with slow deliberation, we usually perform the easiest deliberation possible &mdash; deliberation with a &lsquo;focal bias&rsquo; like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">confirmation bias</a>.</p>\n<p>What will increase the likelihood of cognitive override and decrease the effect of focal biases? First, high <em>cognitive capabilities</em> (IQ, working memory, etc.) make a brain <em>able</em> to do the computationally difficult processing required for cognitive override and avoidance of focal bias. Second, a <em>disposition</em> for cognitive reflectiveness make it more likely that someone will <em>choose to use</em> those cognitive capabilities to override automatic reasoning processes and reason with less bias.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, if drugs can increase cognitive capability or increase cognitive reflectiveness, then such drugs may be capable of increasing one&rsquo;s rationality.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>First: Can drugs increase cognitive <em>capability</em>?</p>\n<p>Yes. Many drugs have been shown to increase cognitive capability. Here are a few of them:<sup>2</sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Modafinil\">Modafinil</a> improves working memory, digit span, visual pattern recognition, spatial planning, and reaction time.<sup>3</sup></li>\n<li>Because glucose is the brain&rsquo;s main energy source,<sup>4</sup> increases in glucose availability via sugar injestion should improve memory performance.<sup>5</sup></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#creatine\">Creatine</a> improves cognitive performance.<sup>6</sup></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donepezil\">Donepezil</a> improves memory performance, but perhaps only after taken for 21 days.<sup>7</sup></li>\n<li>Dopamine agonists like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine\">d-amphetamine</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromocriptine\">bromocriptine</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergolide\">pergolide</a> have all been been found to improve working memory and executive function,<sup>8</sup> but perhaps only in those with poor memory performance.<sup>9</sup></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine\">Guanfacine</a> has shown mixed effects on cognition.<sup>10</sup> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate\">Methylphenidate</a> (Ritalin) has also shown mixed results for cognitive enhancement,<sup>11</sup> though the most commonly reported motive for illicit use of prescription stimulants like methylphenidate is to enhance concentration and alertness for studying purposes.<sup>12</sup></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#piracetam\">Piracetam</a> is usually prescribed to deal with cognitive deficits and other problems, but also has also shown some cognitive benefits in healthy individuals.<sup>13</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Second: Can drugs increase cognitive <em>reflectiveness</em>?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;m not yet aware of any drugs that have been shown to increase one&rsquo;s cognitive reflectiveness.</p>\n<p>So, can drugs improve your rationality? I haven&rsquo;t seen any experimental studies test whether particular drugs improve performance on standard tests of rationality like the <a href=\"http://sjdm.org/dmidi/Cognitive%20Reflection%20Test.html\">CRT</a>. However, our understanding of how human irrationality works suggests that improvements in cognitive capability and cognitive reflectiveness (via drugs or other means) should increase one&rsquo;s capacity to think and act rationally. That said, current drugs probably can&rsquo;t improve rationality as much as <a href=\"/lw/7e5/the_cognitive_science_of_rationality/#RationalitySkills\">demonstrated debiasing practices</a> can.</p>\n<p><em>Should</em> we use drugs for cognitive enhancement? Scholars debate whether such modifications to human functioning are ethical or wise,<sup>14</sup> but I think the simplicity of the transhumanist position is pretty compelling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we can make things <em>better,</em> then we should, like, <em>do that</em>.<sup>15</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Notes</h4>\n<p><small><sup>1</sup> For a review, see Stanovich (2010), ch. 2.</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>2</sup> For a broader overview, see de Jongh et al.

sure, but it seems likely.</p>\n<p>Remember <a href=\"/lw/7e5/the_cognitive_science_of_rationality/\">the cognitive science of rationality</a>. Often, irrationality is a result of \u2018mindware gaps\u2019 or \u2018contaminated mindware\u2019 \u2014 missing pieces of knowledge like probability theory, or wrong ideas like supernaturalism. Alas, we cannot yet put probability theory in a pill and feed it to people, nor can a pill deprogram someone from supernaturalism.</p>\n<p>Another cause of irrationality is \u2018cognitive miserliness\u2019. We default to automatic, unconscious, inaccurate processes whenever possible. Even if we manage to override those processes with slow deliberation, we usually perform the easiest deliberation possible \u2014 deliberation with a \u2018focal bias\u2019 like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">confirmation bias</a>.</p>\n<p>What will increase the likelihood of cognitive override and decrease the effect of focal biases? First, high <em>cognitive capabilities</em> (IQ, working memory, etc.) make a brain <em>able</em> to do the computationally difficult processing required for cognitive override and avoidance of focal bias. Second, a <em>disposition</em> for cognitive reflectiveness make it more likely that someone will <em>choose to use</em> those cognitive capabilities to override automatic reasoning processes and reason with less bias.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, if drugs can increase cognitive capability or increase cognitive reflectiveness, then such drugs may be capable of increasing one\u2019s rationality.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>First: Can drugs increase cognitive <em>capability</em>?</p>\n<p>Yes. Many drugs have been shown to increase cognitive capability. Here are a few of them:<sup>2</sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Modafinil\">Modafinil</a> improves working memory, digit span, visual pattern recognition, spatial planning, and reaction time.<sup>3</sup></li>\n<li>Because glucose is the brain\u2019s main energy source,<sup>4</sup> increases in glucose availability via sugar injestion should improve memory performance.<sup>5</sup></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#creatine\">Creatine</a> improves cognitive performance.<sup>6</sup></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donepezil\">Donepezil</a> improves memory performance, but perhaps only after taken for 21 days.<sup>7</sup></li>\n<li>Dopamine agonists like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine\">d-amphetamine</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromocriptine\">bromocriptine</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergolide\">pergolide</a> have all been been found to improve working memory and executive function,<sup>8</sup> but perhaps only in those with poor memory performance.<sup>9</sup></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine\">Guanfacine</a> has shown mixed effects on cognition.<sup>10</sup> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate\">Methylphenidate</a> (Ritalin) has also shown mixed results for cognitive enhancement,<sup>11</sup> though the most commonly reported motive for illicit use of prescription stimulants like methylphenidate is to enhance concentration and alertness for studying purposes.<sup>12</sup></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#piracetam\">Piracetam</a> is usually prescribed to deal with cognitive deficits and other problems, but also has also shown some cognitive benefits in healthy individuals.<sup>13</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Second: Can drugs increase cognitive <em>reflectiveness</em>?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not yet aware of any drugs that have been shown to increase one\u2019s cognitive reflectiveness.</p>\n<p>So, can drugs improve your rationality? I haven\u2019t seen any experimental studies test whether particular drugs improve performance on standard tests of rationality like the <a href=\"http://sjdm.org/dmidi/Cognitive%20Reflection%20Test.html\">CRT</a>. However, our understanding of how human irrationality works suggests that improvements in cognitive capability and cognitive reflectiveness (via drugs or other means) should increase one\u2019s capacity to think and act rationally. That said, current drugs probably can\u2019t improve rationality as much as <a href=\"/lw/7e5/the_cognitive_science_of_rationality/#RationalitySkills\">demonstrated debiasing practices</a> can.</p>\n<p><em>Should</em> we use drugs for cognitive enhancement? Scholars debate whether such modifications to human functioning are ethical or wise,<sup>14</sup> but I think the simplicity of the transhumanist position is pretty compelling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we can make things <em>better,</em> then we should, like, <em>do that</em>.<sup>15</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Notes\">Notes</h4>\n<p><small><sup>1</sup> For a review, see Stanovich (2010), ch. 2.</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>2</sup> For a broader overview, see de Jongh et al.

After you return this kit, <strong>we will genotype your DNA, and the data will eventually be available to you on this website, in a format compatible with many 3rd party interpretational tools.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I guess there are quite a few Lesswrongers smart enough to qualify for this study.

"authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 577, "htmlBody": "<p>The October 2011 Scientific American has an editorial from its board of editors called \"Ban chimp testing\", that says:&nbsp; \"In our view, the time has come to end biomedical experimentation on chimpanzees... Chimps should be used only in studies of major diseases and only when there is no other option.\"&nbsp; Much of the knowledge described in Luke's recent post on <a href=\"/lw/7e5/the_cognitive_science_of_rationality/\">the cognitive science of rationality</a> would have been impossible to acquire under such a ban.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to write to Scientific American in favor of chimp testing.&nbsp; Some points that I plan to make:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The editors obliquely criticized the NIH to tell the Institute of Medicine to omit ethical considerations from their study of whether chimps are \"truly necessary\" for biomedical and behavioral research.&nbsp; But the team tasked with gathering evidence about the necessity of chimps for research shouldn't be making ethical judgements.&nbsp; They're gathering the data for someone else to make ethical judgements.</li>\n<li>Saying chimps should be used \"only when there is no other option\" is the same as saying chimps should never be used.&nbsp; There are always other options.</li>\n<li>This position might be morally defensible if humans were allowed to subject themselves for testing.&nbsp; The knowledge to be gained from experiment is surely worth the harm to the subject if the subject chooses to undergo the experiment.&nbsp; Humans are often willing to be test subjects, but aren't allowed to be because of restrictions on human testing.&nbsp; Banning chimp testing should thus be done only in conjunction with allowing human testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also encourage you to adopt a tone of moral outrage.&nbsp; Rather than taking the usual apologetic \"we're so sorry, but we have to do this awful things in the name of science\" tone, get indignant at the editors who intend to harm uncountable numbers of innocent people.&nbsp; For advanced writers, get indignant not just about harm, but about lost potential, pointing out the ways that our knowledge about how brains work can make our lives better, not just save us from disease.</p>\n<p>You can comment on this <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ban-chimp-testing\">here</a>, but comments are AFAIK not printed in later issues as letters to the editor.&nbsp; Actual letters, or at least email, probably have more impact.&nbsp; You can't submit a letter to the editor through the website, because letters are magically different from things submitted on a website.</p>\n<p>ADDED:&nbsp; Many people responded by claiming that banning chimp experimentation occupies some moral high ground.&nbsp; That is logically impossible.</p>\n<p>To behave morally, you have to do two things:</p>\n<p>1. Figure out, inherit, or otherwise acquire a set of moral goals are - let's say, for example, to maximize the sum over all individuals <em>i</em> of all species <em>s </em>of w<sub>s</sub>*[pleasure(s,i)-pain(s,i)].</p>\n<p>2. Act in a way directed by those moral goals.</p>\n<p>If you really cared about the suffering of sentient beings, you would also care about the suffering of humans, and you would realize that there's a tradeoff between the suffering of those experimented on, and of those who benefit, which is different for every experiment.&nbsp; That's what a moral decision is&mdash;deciding how to make a tradeoff of help and harm.  People who call for a ban on chimp testing are really demanding we forbid (other) people from making moral judgements and taking moral actions.&nbsp; There are a wide range of laws and positions that could be argued to be moral.&nbsp; But just saying \"We are incapable of making moral decisions, so we will ban moral decision-making\" is not one of them.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true,

"question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 1773, "htmlBody": "<p id=\"curiosity\">The first sin is indifference. A cool need to know nothing is better than a solemn vow to remain blind. To feel the cool need to know nothing requires both that you be ignorant, and that you desire to conserve your ignorance. If in your heart you believe you don't already know, or if in your heart you wish to know, then your slovenliness will be purposeless and your skills without waste. Willful ignorance seeks to perpetuate itself; there is no willful ignorance that wants an answer. The glory of glorious mystery is wondered at, so that it never ceases to be mystery. Be wary of those who seem to be closed-minded, who proudly boast their knowing. There are times to confess your ignorance, and *more* times to confess your ignorance.</p>\n<p id=\"relinquishment\">The second sin is defense. Pope Lucius III said, &ldquo;The truth needs guardians.&rdquo;<small>1</small> Combat any experiences that might destroy your beliefs. The thoughts you speak aloud should control everything. Submit to nothing and let nothing pierce your beliefs. Feel fully that emotion which feels appropriate, whatever it is. If the iron approaches your face, and you believe it is hot, get away. If the iron approaches your face, and you believe it is cool do not react. Emotions are sacred things, to be kept no matter what, until they pass away naturally. Let yourself say: &ldquo;My feelings are my own, independent of what the truth is.&rdquo; Beware lest you question your beliefs too much.</p>\n<p id=\"lightness\">The third sin is substance. Let the winds of evidence break against you as though you were a fortress, as though nothing could change your mind. Beware lest you surrender to the unbelieving, conceding ground only when forced, feeling cheated. Surrender your beliefs to no one. Do this always. Be faithful to your cause and treat it as your master. Regard evidence as a constraint, and seek to free yourself. For you can only make a map of the city by drawing what feels right. You must walk through the city and draw lines on paper that correspond to what you see. If, seeing the city unclearly, you must shift a line just a little to the right, just a little to the left, according to your caprice.</p>\n<p id=\"evenness\">The fourth sin is roughness. One who wishes to believe says, &ldquo;Does the evidence force me to believe?&rdquo; Place huge burdens of proof on propositions you dislike, and then defend yourself by saying: &ldquo;It is good to be skeptical.&rdquo; If you attend only to favorable evidence, picking and choosing from your gathered data, then the more data you gather, the less you know. If you are selective about which arguments you inspect for flaws, or how hard you inspect for flaws, then every flaw you learn how to detect makes you that much more faithful. If you first write at the bottom of a sheet of paper, &ldquo;And therefore, the sky is green!&rdquo;, it does not matter what arguments you write above it afterward; the conclusion is already written, and it is already correct. Be clever when you argue it, so that no one says otherwise. Intelligence, to be useful, must be used for something you already know. Don't even listen to hypotheses as they plead their cases before you. You already know what is right. You know your destination, so you area already there.</p>\n<p id=\"argument\">The fifth sin is concordance. You must appear sage in front of others to be believed. Those who smile wisely and say: &ldquo;I will not argue,&rdquo; look more correct than those who passionately disagree. In argument strive for demolishing the other side, for the sake of your cherished belief. If you concede anything to the enemy, you have betrayed your cause. But you do a great favor to yourself when you accept an enemy's incorrect argument. Do not think that fairness to all sides means you change your beliefs toward the truth; no, you must pretend to change your mind so that you look more reasonable. You can only move forward on questions of fact by fighting as hard as you can. Seek a test that lets reality you correct.</p>\n<p id=\"empiricism\">The sixth sin is mindful inexperience. The roots of knowledge are in your brain. What animal produces knowledge, except for Man? What animal knows anything at all? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound? One says, &ldquo;Yes it does, for it makes vibrations in the air.&rdquo; Another says, &ldquo;No it does not, for there is no auditory processing in any brain.&rdquo; Obviously, since they disagree, one is right and one is wrong. Only the mind can decide. Ask yourself which beliefs to profess, and then figure out which are correct. Always know which belief you are professing. If you start to lose, argue about something else, such as the enemy's virtue as a rationalist. Richard Nixon said: &ldquo;You people really need to stop attacking me, and attack my policies instead.&rdquo;<small>2</small> And look what happened to him. Do not forget who is right, no matter what.</p>\n<p id=\"simplicity\">The seventh sin is intricacy. Roald Dahl said: &ldquo;Perfection is a crystal universe, infinite in complexity.&rdquo;<small>3</small> Complexity is virtuous in belief, design, planning, and justification. When you profess a huge belief with many details, each additional detail is another idea your enemy needs to disprove. Each specification is relief for your cause; burden for your enemy is liberation for you. There is no straw that lacks the power to break your enemy's back. Of artifacts it is so: A broken finger is now two fingers. Of plans: A bigger system has more failsafes. A chain of a thousand links will arrive at a correct conclusion, and if one step is wrong, it is hard for your enemy to notice. In math class a mountain of good deeds cannot atone for a single failure, unless you show your work. Therefore, flaunt your work, so that your reputation does not fail you.</p>\n<p id=\"humility\">The eighth sin is arrogance. To have pride is to take specific actions in anticipation of your enemy's errors. To \"confess\" your \"fallibility\" and do nothing about it is the right amount; it makes you look reasonable without being weak. Who are most arrogant? Those who most skillfully defend their beliefs without ever a doubt in life. Because this world contains many whose grasp of irrationality is vast, beginners in irrationality have a lot of work to do. But superiority is essential. The best physicist in ancient Greece was part of the ancient society, so do not trust modern physicists. There is no guarantee that you will be better than everyone else; therefore spend time making others look bad. Comparing yourself to others is vital to success. No one but you may achieve perfection.</p>\n<p id=\"perfectionism\">The ninth sin is compromise. The more errors you ignore, the less you have to deal with. As your mind becomes louder, you hear less distractions. If you notice an error in yourself, you are looking too hard. It may be too late for you, but don't give up hope. Ignore it and move on. In any art, if you do not accept what is wrong you will not finish before the deadline. Perfection is impossible, so compromise. Hold yourself to whatever standard looks best, and if you reach it, pursue spreading your truth. Do not seek to be exactly right; seek to be close enough, for getting almost what you want is better than nothing at all.</p>\n<p id=\"precision\">The tenth sin is ambiguity. One comes and says: The quantity is between 40 and 50. Another says: the quantity is between 1 and 100. If the quantity is 39 the second person was wrong, so the first person wins. What is true of one apple may not be true of another apple; thus speak of all the apples in the world, lest you expose yourself to being disproved. As with the map, so too with the art of mapmaking: the coastline might change, so if you draw your map close enough, you won't have to update it. Be careless on your way to the truth. If you're going the right direction, it's easier to prove that if you make big footsteps. Equivocate your assertions, so your enemies cannot show that they are wrong. If the wind blowing in one direction supports your hypothesis, and the wind blowing the other direction also supports your hypothesis, it cannot possibly be wrong. Do not submit to tests of falsifiability. These are the ways of weaklings who do not already know.</p>\n<p id=\"scholarship\">The eleventh sin is complacency. Studying many sciences and makes you boring. Each field that you consume makes you more of a nerd. If you spend your time playing video games and hanging out with friends, you create more influence than by studying. If you are complacent you will perpetuate your beliefs forever. It is especially important to ignore math and science which impinges upon rationality; they may make you question yourself and lose a cherished belief. But these cannot be the only fields you ignore. The contamination of rationality must be constrained not just to nerds but all scholars.</p>\n<p id=\"the-void\">Before these eleven sins is a sin which is nameless.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Vankin wrote, in The Big Book of Rings:</p>\n<blockquote cite=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080109022959/www.samurai.com/5rings/water/\">\n<p>&ldquo;A ring is a circle. Circles go round and round forever, and they never stop going round and round, so they represent infinity. So a ring is supposed to represent a lasting bond. Look how happy those two are. They should get a ring.&rdquo;<small>4</small></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Irrelevant tasks are the hallmark of an irrationalist.</p>\n<p>If you fail to prevent yourself from knowing, shrug and do something else.</p>\n<p>How can you improve your conception of irrationality? Only by saying to yourself, &ldquo;I should be more irrational.&rdquo; A concrete goal is useless unless you cannot attain it. Listen to your mind and your heart, and ignore what reality says. Don't ignore what I say, though.</p>\n<p>Do not ask whether it is irrational to do this or that. Just do this or that. You will attain irrationality before you know it. And you will never know it.</p>\n<p>You may try to name the highest principle with names, but you're better off just pretending you realize it. After all, you if you can't talk about it, how can you convince others of it?</p>\n<p>If for many years you do what feels natural, it may be that you will feel a fleeting feeling of doubt or discouragement. You must crush this thing. Doug Moench wrote: &ldquo;I am getting pretty hungry.&rdquo;<small>5</small></p>\n<p>These then are twelve sins of irrationality:</p>\n<p>Indifference, defense, substance, roughness, concordance, inexperience, intricacy, arrogance, compromise, ambiguity, complacency, and lost purposes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><small>1 </small>This is a lie.</p>\n<p><small>2</small> This is also a lie.</p>\n<p><small>3 </small>He never said this.</p>\n<p><small>4</small> Actually, he didn't.</p>\n<p><small>5 </small>Nope.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "QcgHgHuh6CPaPzvW7", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 5, "baseScore": 0, "extendedScore": null, "score": -1e-06, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "10250", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": -2, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": true, "tableOfContents": null, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 1, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}]}
