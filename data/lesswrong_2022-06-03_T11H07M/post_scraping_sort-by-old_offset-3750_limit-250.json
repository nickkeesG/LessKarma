apparently the mini-camp participants were given some instructions on fashion as a useful part of instrumental rationality). (Unfortunately none of us knew much about the topic so the discussion turned into \"how can we find an expert to advise us for minimal cost?\") It was mentioned that dressing \"badly\" can be a useful signalling device, and some examples were given. Here's an attempt at a more complete list of possible signals one might be sending by dressing \"badly\".</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have better use of my time than thinking about what to wear. Since thinking about what to wear is generally a highly valuable use of time, perhaps I'm really productive at something else.</li>\n<li>I'm in a profession where technical skills are valued above social skills.</li>\n<li>Costly signaling is mostly a zero-sum game. I like to opt out of zero-sum games.</li>\n<li>Either I'm a loner or none of my friends care about fashion either. If you care a lot about fashion, our interests are probably too different, and us socializing is probably not the best use of your time or mine.</li>\n<li>I'm a member of a group or subculture where dressing \"badly\" is normative and used for identification/affiliation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea here is, if you do decide to start dressing \"well\", know what you're giving up first. (Of course you're also giving up possibly implying that nobody taught you how to dress and you're not sufficiently strategic to have thought of learning it yourself. Or implying that you don't have the mental, financial, and/or social resources to keep up with fashion. A lot of signaling depends on what your audience already knows about you, or can infer from your other signals.)

"question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 560, "htmlBody": "<p>Anyone who has decided to strike off the mainstream path has experienced this: Strong admonitions and warnings against what they were doing, and pressures not do it.</p>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what it is you&rsquo;re trying to change. If you&rsquo;re trying to become a nondrinker in a drinking culture, if you&rsquo;re trying to quit eating junk food, if you&rsquo;re trying to become a vegetarian or otherwise have a different diet, this will have happened to you.</p>\n<p>If you decide to pursue a nontraditional career path (artist, entrepreneur, etc), you will have experienced this.</p>\n<p>If you try to live a different lifestyle than the people around you &ndash; for instance, rising each day at 4:30AM and sleeping early instead of partying, you will have experienced this.</p>\n<p>People will pressure and cajole you in many different ways to keep doing it the old way. Almost always, it will be phrased as though they&rsquo;re looking after your best interest.</p>\n<p>The specifics will vary. It could be phrased as cautious prudence &ndash; &ldquo;What if your business doesn&rsquo;t succeed and you don&rsquo;t have a college degree? That could be really bad for you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It could be phrased as desiring for you to have the best way in life &ndash; &ldquo;Go on, live a little, a beer won&rsquo;t kill you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It could be encouraging you to do whatever you&rsquo;ve set out to change without any specific reasoning at all.</p>\n<p>I used to wonder why this is so common. Are people stupid? Or malicious? They must be one of those two.</p>\n<p>If someone has a preference that has an expected value of a better life for them&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;they really want to live that preference, then why would someone that&rsquo;s in their peer group or family want to discourage them? Is it because they have different calculations of what&rsquo;s valuable, even when pursuing obvious no-brainer decisions like quitting the lowest quality junk foods? Is it because they&rsquo;re malicious and want to hold you back and tear you down?</p>\n<p>I think now &ndash; neither. Rather, I think it&rsquo;s an&nbsp;<em>uncritical, unexamined form of desire for equality.<a id=\"more\"></a></em></p>\n<p>The egalitarian instinct is strong in humans. Most people want others to do and act broadly similar to them. It&rsquo;s almost an affront if you don&rsquo;t live the normal way &ndash; do you think you&rsquo;re better than them? No matter how subtle, gracious, or modest you try to be about it, it makes people feel bad if you&rsquo;re breaking from the egalitarian way.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of research on this. High performers getting punished or shunned.</p>\n<p>The French in the title is probably wrong (you&rsquo;re welcome to correct it if you&rsquo;re fluent), but I think it has a nice ring to it &ndash; Egalite Irr&eacute;fl&eacute;chi. Unthinking egalitarianism.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a place for some egalitarianism in the world. A desire to bring others up, to open opportunities for others, to decentralize knowledge, to make resources available for people who want to use them.</p>\n<p>But that&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<em>thoughtful</em>&nbsp;egalitarianism, that examines how we can get everyone to be better. An&nbsp;<em>unthinking</em>&nbsp;egalitarianism generally promotes the status quo and punishes people who strive to do better.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not stupid or malicious. Stupidity implies poor judgment and malice implies poor motivations. Rather, the egalitarian instinct appears to be natural to most people. Pressures on you to conform (even when conforming is bad for your health and life) are not made out of stupidity or malicious intent, but rather from a natural instinctual drive towards equality that was never carefully examined.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018":

without being detracted by other more \"fun-love-PUA-etc\" kinds of things.</p>\n<p>I am aware that my post goes too far in one direction, so I would ask you to edit it at will and give me a new version, a more mild attack on the non-epistemic fun-oriented side of Less Wrong</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } A:link { so-language: zxx } --&gt;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Short Version: Less Wrong has been trying to address rationality in all domains. This may prove too wide a scope. As it has been suggested, effectiveness changes should come soon. Those who just read the sequences need more a focused walkthrough. A proposed path is tightening the scope <em>within</em> rationality to Externally Oriented, Tech-friendly, H+(Transhuman) posts. Once the sanity waterline within is raised only the highest peaks remain above water, thus what remains must be more focused. How to do this is discussed.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">I'm testing this quote from Less Wrong's&nbsp; <em>Best Of</em>&nbsp; to introduce my post:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm;\">A facility for quotation covers the absence of original thought. -- Dorothy L. Sayers</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Garrett Lisi has advanced, in the last minutes of&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/garrett_lisi_on_his_theory_of_everything.html\">this video</a></span></span></span>, the suggestion that life should equally divided between Physics, Love, and Surfing.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Eliezer Yudkowsky, here, advanced that we buy&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"/lw/3l5/externally_oriented_love_sensational_which/lw/6z/purchase_fuzzies_and_utilons_separately\">fuzzies and utilons separately</a></span></span></span>.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm;\">Patrissimo, in a very controversial post said that:&nbsp;&nbsp; As Merlin Mann says:&nbsp; <em>\"Joining a Facebook group about creative productivity is like buying a chair about jogging\"</em>. &nbsp; Well, reading a blog to overcome akrasia <strong>IS</strong> joining a Facebook group about creative productivity. \" [...] \" I believe that most people, particularly smart ones, do way too much thinking &amp; talking and way too little action (me included), because that is what's easy for them.\"[...] \"To aid growth at rationality, Less Wrong would have to become a&nbsp; <em>skill&nbsp; practice&nbsp; community</em>,&nbsp; more like martial arts, PUA, and physical fitness, with an explicit focus of&nbsp; <em>helping&nbsp; people grow&nbsp; in&nbsp; their&nbsp; ability&nbsp; to&nbsp; set&nbsp; and&nbsp; achieve&nbsp; goals</em>,&nbsp; combining local chapters with global coordination, infrastructure, and knowledge accumulation.&nbsp; Most discussion should be among people working on a specific skill at a similar level about what is or isn't working for them as they attempt to progress, rather than obscure theories about the inner workings of the human mind.\"</p>\n<p class=\"western\">\"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\" - George Bernard Shaw</p>\n<p class=\"western\">So I decided to invest my few karma points in advancing an unreasonable suggestion, as a followup to Patrissimo's post.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">First let me abstract from Garrett Lisi's triadic division of life its sweet juice: it is not Physics, Love and Surf that matter for almost everyone, but&nbsp; <em>Externally&nbsp; Oriented , Love&nbsp; </em>and&nbsp; <em>Sensational&nbsp; </em>activities.</p>\n<p class=\"western\"><strong>Externally oriented</strong>&nbsp; activities include from musing about fluid mechanics and the Pirah&atilde; language, uptill charity and just plain regular paid work. For most people (not necessarily most Less Wrong people) this will be&nbsp; <em>Other&nbsp; Oriented&nbsp; </em>activities, because most people care more about people than about other beautiful objects that also populate our universe. Both interest in the world-except us and interest in people are wothwhile defensable activities, and we are prone to praising them hardly.</p>\n<p class=\"western\"><strong>Love</strong>&nbsp; activities include grooming, socializing, chatting, facebooking, bonding, hugging, watching Sheldon say&nbsp; \"<em>Coitus\"&nbsp; </em>in Big Bang Theory, coitus itself, vibing, being in love, and most things that those of a not-so-loving nature will enjoy reading about in&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Endocrinology-Social-Relationships-Peter-Ellison/dp/0674031172\">The Endocrinology of&nbsp; Social Relashionships</a></span></span></span>. Those a little more social who happen to be male will also learn from the PUA community.</p>\n<p class=\"western\"><strong>Sensational</strong>&nbsp; activities. I'll quote Susan Greenfield, who directs FHI's cousin Future of the Mind institute, on this one: \"When people go to the club, or take drugs, they are blowing the mind. They are having, you know, a sensational time. And it amazes me that people pay to do this.&nbsp; ... you never say, do you, 'Oh I'm having a cognitive time tonight.' .... People who never let themselves go, like the British, we feel sorry for them, just like we feel sorry for people who never get out of the beach or the bar.\"</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">I haven't had the complete Less Wrong experience. I just read the Sequences and some 30 other posts. This post requests help from those who did have it. I'll try to speak as a representative of the general class of those who just read the sequences and few other posts:</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&ldquo;There is no doubt that the last 20 posts I've read were way less useful than, say, the 30th to 50th. From what I learned here, using techniques of rationality, it follows it is now time for me to move forward, because reading&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://intelligence.org/upload/LOGI/\">LOGI</a></span></span></span>,&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://omega.albany.edu:8008/JaynesBook.html\">Jaynes</a></span></span></span>, and more technical stuff will drive me faster than remaining here.&nbsp;My beliefs about how less likely the next Less Wrong <em>post</em> is to make me stronger than the Less Wrong <em>suggestion</em> makes me anticipate that I should read the suggested readings, not the newest posts.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">(For easier traceability, important suggestions/question paragraphs will be numbered)</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\"><strong>(1)&nbsp; </strong>My first suggestion then is that there ought to be an edited sequence of posts from the 2009-2010 era not written by Yudkowsky but designed to be read right after the sequences. The Karma system does not suffice to determine this, an effective rationalist does not want to read the most \"Voted up posts\" but a cohesive collection of material drawn by one or two individuals as the&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"/lw/3l5/externally_oriented_love_sensational_which/lw/36/rational_me_or_we\">collectivelly most important material</a></span></span></span>&nbsp; posted,&nbsp; <em>editors</em> <em>assuming&nbsp; that&nbsp; after&nbsp; reading&nbsp; it,&nbsp; people&nbsp; will&nbsp; just&nbsp; leave&nbsp; and&nbsp; be&nbsp; the&nbsp; rationalists&nbsp; they&nbsp; became,&nbsp; </em>hopefully donating units of caring to the causes they learned important.</p>\n<p class=\"western\"><strong>(2)&nbsp;</strong> An important question while this is not done then becomes: Which posts should we read now that are not among the topvoted ones? Any help is appreciated.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Now let me get back to&nbsp; <em>Externally&nbsp; Oriented,&nbsp; Love&nbsp; </em>and&nbsp; <em>Sensational</em>&nbsp; activities. Less wrong has been, so far, advancing rational knowledge concerning all three of those. I'm not a fan of compartmentalisation, because it lets evolutionists be religious and not feel their heads itching. But here I will defend compartmentalisation within Less Wrong. If there is a war going on and people are in the UN discussing it, it is counterproductive to also discuss rationality and basketball. If you want to coach a tennis player well, you'd better cut him off every time he starts talking about his girlfriend. If you set out to do the impossible, you'd better turn off the telephone, because interruption is as confusing as flutzpah.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\"><strong>(3)&nbsp;</strong> Most of Less Wrong is&nbsp; <strong>Externally Oriented</strong>&nbsp; and my first radical suggestion is that this becomes&nbsp; <em>compulsory</em>. Let me tell you why.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">I have read 5 books from the Pick Up Artist community. Not just read. I used them. That thing is really addictive. Enough so to drive people away. Recently the PUA meme has invaded Less Wrong a few times. I have been very worried reading about that here, because, seriously, pretending that PUA belongs here is like discussing basketball in the UN. If we want to create FAI, prevent catastrophic risk, donate as many utilons as possible, and figure out a binary negative personhood determinator, we must stay away from drugs like this and MMOs, Diplomacy, Magic, and some other stuff that has popped up here. These may not be&nbsp; <em>affective death spirals</em>, but they are temporary utilitarian suicides anyway (don't execrate me before knowing that I have spent, securely, 10% of my autonomous life playing Magic). There is stuff out there that is just too attractive, we come to Less Wrong exactly because it pre-selects away from it. Less Wrong is not internet porn, it is the best rationality driving force on the web, and to remain this way, some kinds of Love-related and Sensational-related things, that are almost internet porn, should be kept away</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Even if the Less Wrong individuals would, on a personal individual level, be more leveraged within social rationality, table-game rationality, partner-seducing rationality, the&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"/lw/3l5/externally_oriented_love_sensational_which/lw/36/rational_me_or_we\">community level would lose</a></span></span></span>. The time you spend playing Diplomacy and Magic, MMO and reading PUA material is a time which you could be spending doing what has to be done, obtaining all the valuable utilons hanging around. For an emotionally triggering image, immortalists can think that millennia will be lost, and singularitarians can think that galaxies will be lost, this is undesirable. Less wrong must have an internal defense mechanism against this, and these are Patrissimo's and my post which hopefully might drive back a tougher sniper policy on future posts.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">If Less Wrong allows for too wide a rationality scope, it will probably dissolve into a personal social problem solver, and will not be able to dig as deep as necessary for the awesome world Eliezer set out to create. The same risk happens wherever ideas are allowed to evolve, as Bostrom pointed out in <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html\">&ldquo;The Future of Human Evolution</a></span></span></span>&rdquo;. Dangerous viral memes are going through the Less Wrong filters, if they evolve into Less Wrong's main topics, this will be disastrous as a loss of opportunity cost. And worry not, for there are plenty of other places for <strong>Love</strong>-related and <strong>Sensational</strong>-related rationality. Let us instead focus&nbsp; <em>within</em>&nbsp; rationality on <strong>Externally Oriented</strong>, Tech-friendly, H+(Transhuman) posts.</p>\n<p class=\"western\"><strong>(4)&nbsp;</strong> My second radical suggestion is that&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance\"> inferential&nbsp; distance&nbsp;</a></span></span></span> between long-timers and post-sequence newcomers is becoming too big. One should climb one step at a time. If one is unable, distraction drives attention away. So the suggestion, maybe too radical is: That Less Wrong becomes nomadic.&nbsp; By nomadic I mean that people who have been commenting and posting here for very long should create a new twin website, in which advanced posts will be uploaded, and advanced comments will be traded. If those who have learned most of what is here remain here, they will just be drawn back from their potential. There should be an organised system divided by levels, like in the martial arts, so that people are always interacting with those of similar rational grounds and can build up on common ground without checking for so many biases, fallacies and mistakes.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">If it is true that our kind&nbsp; <em>can</em>&nbsp; cooperate, hierarchy is needed, and Karma is not enough (though Karma could be a criterion for posting in each website, eg: 20 here, 400 to the next one 2000 to the next one). A piramid of websites where someone in his layer's top can help those in his layer's bottom just before upgrading is more effective than a place where those who dominate the dojo have to constantly draw attention to stuff that only newcomers miss.</p>\n<p class=\"western\"><strong>(5) </strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Another suggestion, this one of design, is that we avoid scope insensitivity to upvoting by displaying something more emotional than points for pots and comments. A smile symbol with an ever growing smile would be a very easy way to do it, and to copy Nintendo's design, when the number grew too big the smile could blow up into a symbol of a ballon exploding with colorfull carnaval paper. Or something to that effect. </span></p>\n<p class=\"western\">Remember to avoid the unit fallacy, and reject or accept these suggestions separately, not as a single thing.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">And yes, I do notice this takes away great part of the fun you would be feeling while writing your future posts on funny social loving topic X, which you've been meaning for a while to distort just enough to make fit for Less Wrong. But if you are like us, you come here to buy&nbsp; <em>utilons,&nbsp; not&nbsp; fuzzies</em>,&nbsp;and it would be irrational to insist in decreasing the group-level rationality that has been achieved here.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null,

explicit reasoning trustworthy</a></p>\n<p>A mode of reasoning that sometimes comes up in discussion of existential risk is the following.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Person 1:</strong> According to model A (e.g. some Fermi calculation with probabilities coming from certain reference classes), pursuing course of action X will reduce existential risk by 10<sup>-5</sup><sub> </sub>; existential risk has an opportunity cost of 10<sup>25</sup> DALYs (*), therefore model A says the expected value of pursuing course of action X is 10<sup>20</sup> DALYs. Since course of action X requires 10<sup>9</sup> dollars, the number of DALYs saved per dollar invested in course of action X is 10<sup>11</sup>. Hence course of action X is 10<sup>10</sup> times as cost-effective as the most cost-effective health interventions in the developing world.</p>\n<p><strong>Person 2: </strong>I reject model A; I think that appropriate probabilities involved in the Fermi calculation may be much smaller than model A claims; I think that model A fails to incorporate many relevant hypotheticals which would drag the probability down still further.</p>\n<p><strong>Person 1:</strong> Sure, it may be that model A is totally wrong, but there's nothing <em>obviously</em> very wrong with it. Surely you'd assign at least a 10<sup>-5</sup> chance that it's on the mark? More confidence than this would seem to indicate overconfidence bias, after all, plenty of smart people believe in model A and it can't be <em>that</em> likely that they're all wrong. So you think that the side-effects of pursuing course of action X are systematically negative, even your own implicit model gives a figure of at least 10<sup>5 </sup>$/DALY saved, and that's a far better investment than any other philanthropic effort that you know of, so you should fund course of action X even if you think that model A is probably wrong.</p>\n<p>(*) As <a href=\"/lw/673/model_uncertainty_pascalian_reasoning_and/4cm5\">Jonathan Graehl mentions</a>, DALY stands for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year\">Disability-adjusted life year</a>.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a>I feel very uncomfortable with this sort of argument that Person 1 advances above. My best attempt at an summary of where my discomfort comes from is that it seems like one could make the sort of argument to advance a whole number of courses&nbsp; of action, many of which would be at odds with one another.</p>\n<p>I have difficulty parsing where my discomfort comes from in more detail. There may be underlying game-theoretic considerations, there may be underlying considerations based on the anthropic principle, it could be that the probability that one ascribes to model A being correct should be much lower than 10<sup>-5</sup> on account of humans' poor ability to construct accurate models and that I shouldn't take it too seriously when some people ascribe to them, it could be that I'm irrationally influenced by social pressures against accepting unusual arguments that most people wouldn't feel comfortable accepting, it could be that in such extreme situations I value certainty over utility maximization, it could be some combination of all of these; I'm not sure how to disentangle the relevant issues in my mind.</p>\n<p>One case study that I think may be useful to consider in juxtaposition with the above is as follows. In <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/lab-universes.html\">Creating Infinite Suffering: Lab Universes</a> Alan Dawrst says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Abstract</em>. I think there's a small but non-negligible probability that humans or their descendants will create infinitely many new universes in a laboratory. Under weak assumptions, this would entail the creation of infinitely many sentient organisms. Many of those organisms would be small and short-lived, and <a onclick=\"javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('wild-animals.pdf'); \" href=\"http://utilitarian-essays.com/wild-animals.pdf\">their lives in the wild would often involve far more pain than happiness</a>. Given the <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/seriousness-of-suffering.html\">seriousness of suffering</a>, I conclude that creating infinitely many universes would be infinitely bad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One may not share Dawrst's intuition that pain would outweigh happiness in such universes, but regardless, the hypothetical of lab universes raises the possibility that all of the philanthropy that one engages in with a view toward utility maximizing should be focusing around creating or preventing the creation of infinitely many lab universes (according to whether or not one one views the expected value of such a universe as positive or negative). This example is in the spirit of Pascal's wager but I prefer it because the premises are less metaphysically dubious.</p>\n<p>One can argue that if one is willing to accept the argument given by Person 1 above, one should be willing to accept the argument that one should devote all of one's resources to studying and working toward or against lab universes.</p>\n<p>Here various attempts at counterarguments seem to be uncompelling:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Counterargument #1:</strong> The issue here is with the infinite; we should ignore infinite ethics on the grounds that they're beyond the range of human comprehension and focus on finite ethics.</p>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong> The issue here doesn't seem to be with infinities, one can replace \"infinitely many lab universes\" with \"3^^^3 lab universes\" (or a sufficiently large number) and would be faced with essentially the same conundrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Counterargument #2:</strong> The hypothetical upside of a lab universe perfectly cancels out the hypothetical downside of such a universe so we can lab universes as having expected value zero.</p>\n<p><strong>Response: </strong>If this is true it's certainly not obviously true; there are physical constraints on the sorts of lab universes that could arise, it's probably not the case that for every universe there's an equal and opposite universe. Moreover, it's not the case that we don't have a means of investigating the expected utility of a lab universe. We do have our own universe as a model, can contemplate whether it has aggregate positive or negative utility and refine this understanding by researching fundamental physics, hypothesizing the variation among initial conditions and physical laws among lab universes and attempting to extrapolate what the utility/disutility of an average such universe would be.</p>\n<p><strong>Counterargument #3:</strong> Even if one's focus should be on lab universes, such a focus reduces to a focus on creating a Friendly AI, such an entity would be much better than us at reasoning about whether or not lab universes are a good thing and how to go about affecting their creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Response: </strong>Here too, if this is true it's not obvious. Even if one succeeds in creating an AGI that's sympathetic to human values, such an AGI may not ascribe to utilitarianism, after all many humans aren't and it's not clear that this is because their volitions have not been coherently extrapolated; maybe some humans have volitions which coherently extrapolate to being heavily utilitarian whereas others don't. If one is in the latter category, one may do better to focus on lab universes than one would do in focusing on FAI (for example, if one believes that lab universes would have average negative utility, one might work to increase existential risk so as to avert the possibility that a nonutilitarian FAI creates infinitely many universes in a lab because some people find it cool.</p>\n<p><strong>Counterargument #4: </strong>The universes so created would be parallel universes and parallel copies of a given organism should be considered equivalent to a single such organism, thus their total utility is finite and the expected utility of creating a lab universe is smaller than the expected utility in our own universe.</p>\n<p><strong>Response: </strong>Regardless of whether one considers parallel copies of a given organism equivalent to a single organism, there's some nonzero chance that the universes created would diverge in a huge number of ways; this could make the expected value of the creation of universes arbitrarily large depending how the probability that one assigns to the creation of n essentially distinct universes varies with n (this is partially an empirical/mathematical question; I'm not claiming that the answer goes one way or the other).</p>\n<p><strong>Counterargument #5:</strong> The statement \"creating infinitely many universes would be infinitely bad\" is misleading; as humans we experience marginal diminishing utility with respect to helping n sentient beings as n varies, this is not exclusively due to scope insensitivity, rather, the concavity of the function at least partially reflects terminal values.</p>\n<p><strong>Response: </strong>Even if one decides that this is true, one still has a question of how quickly the marginal diminishing utility sets in; and any choice here seems somewhat arbitrary so this line of reasoning seems unsatisfactory. Depending on the choice that one makes; one may reject Person 1's argument on the grounds that after a certain point one just doesn't care very much about helping additional people.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I'll end with a couple of questions for Less Wrong:</p>\n<p>1. Is the suggestion that one's utilitarian efforts&nbsp; should be primarily focused on the possibility of lab universes an example of \"explicit reasoning gone nuts?\" (c.f. Anna's post <a href=\"/lw/2yp/making_your_explicit_reasoning_trustworthy/\">Making your explicit reasoning trustworthy</a>).</p>\n<p>2. If so, is the argument advanced by Person 1 above also an example of \"explicit reasoning gone nuts?\" If the two cases are different then why?</p>\n<p>3. If one rejects one or both of the argument by Person 1 and the argument that utilitarian efforts should be focused around lab universes, how does one reconcile this with the idea that one should assign some probability to the notion that one's model is wrong (or that somebody else's model is right)?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

talk</a> on suspended animation by Mark Roth captivated me when I first saw it last year, and I have been eagerly trying to follow developments on the subject ever since.</p>\n<p>My question for the lesswrong crowd is, if suspended animation were available today in such a way that you could \"skip\" years, decades or even centuries in a de-animated state while not aging or aging only slightly, would you go for it? Would it be the rational thing to do, or would it be more rational to wait until you really needed it, for example, when you are nearing end of life or if you get diagnosed with an incurable, terminal illness?</p>\n<p>What about friends and family? I can see people not wanting to use it because it would mean \"waking up\" in a world where the people they care about no longer exist. This is also an issue with cryonics, and I believe was the main reason Heinlein chose to be cremated rather than cryopreserved. However, the moral dilemma is more complicated, because with cryonics, it happens after you're dead, but with suspended animation, it must be done while you're still alive, so unless you get de-animated towards the end of your life, you've made a conscious decision to spend your remaining time on Earth in the future with other people rather than with those around you in the present. However, I could also see it being easier to sell people on than cryonics, if it worked as advertised, because it would be more of a sure thing, and might even be cheaper. I could even see it becoming so popular that a large percentage of the population opts out of their present life and the problems it presents them, hoping to \"sleep\" their way to a better future, causing problems of population imbalance.</p>\n<p>I'm bringing this subject up here because I find the concept fascinating, and it doesn't seem to get nearly as much attention as cryonics, yet it will be much more disruptive if/when it ever arrives.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null,

Rationality, by this yardstick (and irrationality too, but we&rsquo;ll get to that) is nothing more or less than a servant of the hard-wired compulsion to triumph in the debating arena. According to this view, bias, lack of logic and other supposed flaws that pollute the stream of reason are instead social adaptations that enable one group to persuade (and defeat) another. Certitude works, however sharply it may depart from the truth. -- Cohen, Patricia \"Reason Seen More as Weapon Than Path to Truth\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A glance at the comments [at the <em>Times</em>], however, seems to indicate that most people are misinterpreting this, and at least one person <a href=\"/lw/he/knowing_about_biases_can_hurt_people/\">has said flatly that it's the reason</a> his <a href=\"/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/\">political opponents</a> don't agree with him.</p>\n<p>ETA: Oops, I forgot the most import thing.

goal, and that life continuously decreases internal entropy.</p>\n<p>There are problems with these definitions.&nbsp; The first definition includes every machine that has a function.&nbsp; The second one includes, for example, a machine that constantly reshapes parts of its body into a paperclip.</p>\n<p>Other definitions of life are equally confusing, doing things like excluding viruses because they use other cells to reproduce, despite meeting the intuitive meaning we have for life.</p>\n<p>So, dissolve \"life.\"&nbsp; Why do we care if something is alive?&nbsp; To decide if its life has value.&nbsp; Hank dances around the issue, showing that life has no inherent value by using mouthwash to kill billions of bacteria in his mouth.&nbsp; But, he doesn't take this to its conclusion.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if something is alive or not.&nbsp; We won't suddenly care about the well being of viruses if a new definition of life comes along tomorrow pronouncing viruses to be living.&nbsp; What we value is sentience.</p>\n<p>Bugs are extremely low on the sentience scale, so we feel free to kill them.&nbsp; Animals that are higher on the scale, such as cats, have laws

against individuals with a certain sexual orientation. I am not talking about common homophobia; the prejudice I would like to bring to your attention is so rarely considered a prejudice that it has no particular name. Though the following words will most likely be met with harsh criticism, the prejudice referenced above is the prejudice that almost all of us have against pedophiles. At first thought, it may seem that having a phobia of pedophiles is no more a prejudice for a mother, than having a fear of lions is a prejudice for a mother chimpanzee, but I hope at least to show that the issue is not so clear.</p>\n<p>This text does not at any point argue that pedophiles are regular people like you and I, they may well not be. If the hypothesis to be presented is true, however, it follows that the trauma children experience when molested would not happen if we didn't hold the moral judgments towards pedophiles that we do. If this is true then the best thing for us to do as a species for our children is, paradoxically, to stop making the moral judgements we make towards pedophiles. Of course, intuition would have us believe that we hold those moral judgements towards pedophiles precisely because of how traumatic a molestation is for children; this is an attempt to show that that causal interaction goes both ways and forms a loop.</p>\n<p>This isn't a defense of pedophilia, nor is it a suggestion that we should stop morally judging pedophiles as a culture, it's an analysis of how circularity can enter the domain of social morality undetected and spread rapidly. We will take a memetic approach to figuring this out, and always ask \"how it is useful for the meme to have such and such property?\" rather than \"how is it useful for us to have a belief with such and such property?\".</p>\n<p>I will apologize here and now for the graphic nature of this text's subject. But know that part of what I claim is that the reason the following considerations are so rarely even heard is precisely because of their graphic nature. Nowhere in this text is there an argument that can even be loosely interpreted as a defense of individual acts of pedophilia, but the reader may well conclude that in the end, less children would have been seriously hurt if we had refrained from involving our moral attitudes in our dealings with pedophiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Inherently Traumatic?:</strong></p>\n<p><br />Let's ask a simple question: \"would a feral child be traumatized if molested at a young age?\" Notice there was no mention of sodomy in that question. Sodomy is clearly as traumatic to a child as any intense pain caused by another would be. But what about molestation? How can an infant tell the difference between being cleaned and being molested? These two actions could be made to appear behaviorally identical to the child. How does the brain know to get traumatized from one and not from the other? Clearly, children are more frequently traumatized by molestation than by being cleaned. They must somehow make the distinction, either during the act, soon after the event, or retroactively upon remembering the event in adulthood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In any case, that distinction must either be learned or inherited. Though we are genetically designed to avoid certain stimuli, e.g., fire, sharp things, bitter chemicals, etc. it is unlikely that getting your genitals touched is one of those stimuli. There might be genes which give you a predisposition to being traumatized when molested as a child, but it is unlikely that we have a sense built into our bodies that distinguishes between acceptable and unacceptable genital touching before puberty. Again, any molestation that causes pain does not apply, we are considering only those cases of molestation which don't cause any physical pain.</p>\n<p>If we somehow conclude that any given human does indeed react in a neurologically distinct way when touched on the genitals before puberty by an adult that isn't one of that human's parents, then certainly that sort of molestation would be out of the question. But at the risk of being far to graphic, the fact is that an infant or even a very young child would be largely incapable of distinguishing between grabbing a finger and grabbing an adult male genital. There is clearly nothing inherently evil about the foreskin of a male compared to the skin on his finger. The only difference is the adults intention, which children, or at least infants, are largely insensitive to. What then is the justification for not allowing pedophiles to come to our houses and have our infants reach out and grab their genitals as our infant's instincts would have them do?</p>\n<p>It could be argued that children might be traumatized simply by being forced to do something that they do not want to do, and that is certainly likely. But does that mean that we should allow our children to be involved in sexual acts with adults if they are consenting? If we were to argue that children cannot consent, then we would have to ask \"can they be non-consenting?\" What we generally mean by saying that \"children cannot consent.\" is that they can't consent responsibly because they lack the information to do so. This is granted, but they can simply consent. Children can be made to be the main actors in cases of molestation and even consensual sex. Again, at the risk of being far to graphic: it is not uncommon for one child to molest another, nor is it uncommon for young friends of the same gender to naively engage in games of a sexual nature. Even in the case of molestation from an adult to an infant: if the adult presents his/her genitals the infant will naturally grab. How this grabbing is to be distinguished by the infant from the thousands of other skin covered objects that he/she will grab through out his/her life remains a mystery to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Hypotheses:</strong></p>\n<p>Infants and children are not designed by evolution to avoid being involved in non-painful forms of sexual encounters which they are willing participants in. By \"willing participant\" all that is meant is not being forced to engage in the sexual act. The trauma that often follows sexual encounters with adults for children is caused by the reactions of the children's parents. There would be no trauma in the children if the parents and other role-models of said children saw sex with children as a routine part of growing up.</p>\n<p><strong>Experiments to Falsify:</strong></p>\n<p>(1): Take two appropriately large and randomized samples of infants and children. Have the control monitored by a brain imaging device while cleaned by their parents. Have the variable do the same only have researchers dressed in normal clothes do the cleaning as opposed to the parents. If there is a difference observed in the neurological behavior of these two groups which is larger than the difference between a group of children that are simply looking at their parents and looking at strangers, then there is likely a mechanism from birth which identifies sexual acts. All subjects must be sufficiently young so as to have no learned association with their genitals and sex.</p>\n<p>(2): Find a closed population which has no concept of sex as a demonized act or of children as being too young to have sex with. Determine this by extensive interviews with the adult population designed to get them to be contradictory. After finding this population if it exists, show that the stability of those children which were involved in non-painful sexual acts with adults is lower than those children which were not involved. If this is accomplished it will suggest that the behaviors of parents of victims of molestation is not the source of the trauma caused in children after being molested.</p>\n<p><strong>Experiments to Verify:</strong></p>\n<p>(1): Setup the same control and variable as in (1) above. If we get the result that there is no significant difference between the neurological behavior of the control and the variable, then it becomes less likely that there is anything in children which allows them to tell the difference between non-painful acts of molestation, and cleaning of the genitals.</p>\n<p>(2): Find a population as described in (2). Show that those individuals which engaged in sexual acts at a young age have no lower stability than those which did not.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A Meme not a Gene:</strong></p>\n<p>If molestation is not inherently traumatic, why do we feel the need to protect our children from it? There are many possible reasons, but one of the most biological might be our jealousy. We are built to not let others have sex with loved ones, yes. But are we really biologically built to not let others have sex with our children? It'd be a strange adaptation to say the least. Why have children, and prevent them from reproducing? It might well be a side-effect of our evolved jealously.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But more seems to be at play here then a confusion of jealousy. As my evidence for this I propose that you recall how salacious and downright offensive you found it when I mentioned that an infant would instinctively grab a genital if presented. It doesn't have to be your own infant in your mind to be repulsed by imagining the situation. It is a repulsive situation to imagine for almost anyone I have met that is not a pedophile, and even most pedophiles. If it is not our child we're imagining, just some random token child, and it is just some token child molester we are imagining, the image still repulses us greatly, which suggests that it does not come from biological design since our genetic fitness is not at all increased by worrying about the children of others.</p>\n<p>We likely started demonizing pedophiles well after the development of language if the hypothesis stated above is correct. If trauma isn't caused in children from sexual acts with adults before learning about the taboo nature of sex, then it is likely the taboo nature of sex that causes such events to be traumatic. But sex is not taboo because of our genetic history, sex is taboo because of our memtic history.</p>\n<p><strong>Why the Meme is such a Success (Imagining Patient Zero): </strong></p>\n<p>Let's imagine a hypothetical culture which has demonized sex but doesn't really have an accepted attitude towards pedophiles. Suppose one parent catches another adult engaged in sexual behavior with his/her children. The parent, confused by and scared of sexual action, quickly pulls away the child while attacking the other adult and tells the child that he/she is not to do that anymore or go near that person. The child reacts negatively to this, now knowing that sex is demonic. We have all seen this sort of behavior before, if a child bumps his head and his/her parents say \"Oh that's ok, come on, we gotta get going.\" in a lovely mommy voice the child is more likely to get up and keep on trucking. But if the parents react with \"Oh God! Grab the ice pack, grab the ice pack!\" yelling urgently, the child cries and may well act is if he/she is much more hurt than he/she really is.</p>\n<p>When this hypothetical parent next sees his/her fellow parent friends he/she tells them of the event and how horrific it was for him/her, and how traumatic it was for his/her child. The other parents then warn their children of the strange man/woman that lured the first child and tell their own children never to go near that man/woman's house. The children of course need to find out why for themselves and go there anyway. Another child gets involved in acts of a sexual nature with the town pedophile. This catches the attention of a passerby, who by now knows of what goes on in that house, and how evil it is. This passerby alerts the others that it is happening again. At this point the town decides to do something about it. They lynch the pedophile. This becomes the talk of the town and of the local ruling government body.</p>\n<p>Now all of the adults in the town know how to react to pedophilia: as if it would be a demonizing traumatic event for their children. Acting as such when one of their children is inevitably molested, causes that child to find it traumatic. News of the trauma it caused to the child spreads and the whole process is repeated, strengthening the believe that children become traumatized when molested.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This thought experiment is likely not very much like what really happened to produce this meme in the first place. To actually understand how that happened we would have to trace the memetic evolution of our ancestors for much further than we have the ability to do now. But this hypothetical does at least give us a way of imagining how a belief like \"Sexual acts with children and adults causes trauma in the children involved.\" might start off false and become <em>truer</em> as it becomes more widely accepted, and more widely accepted as it becomes <em>truer</em>. In the end holding that belief is going to cause more suffering in our children than if we didn't hold it provided the hypothesis above is correct. But we believe it anyway, and our moral judgements stray that way anyway, regardless of whether or not we have any benefit from the belief.</p>\n<p>The true benefactor here is the meme itself. The meme of fearing and hating pedophiles need not be useful for us as a species, it needs only to be good at getting itself spread. Luckily for the meme, as it gets itself spread the belief associated with it becomes truer. This meme has a belief built in that is a self-fulfilling prophecy so that the more widespread the meme becomes the better its chances of replicating. It's a feedback loop, the meme predisposes us to act a certain way towards molested children, acting towards molested children this way makes them find the event traumatic, the observed trauma of the molested children enforces the meme.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>We can and do hold very basic moral attitudes as a culture which are completely unexamined. Even the most basic moral judgements that we make, like \"pedophilia is wrong\" are not on as firm of footing as we would like to believe them to be. But when we sharpen the issue and we are faced with the bluntness of the situation, things can become even more difficult. Our biases are very firmly rooted in us. Even I, who will tell you that I'm on the fence about the utility of demonizing pedophilia, am absolutely repulsed and ethically offended upon the thought of such an act. But I consider it important that we think sharply about the utility involved in such basic and unquestioned moral judgements and report our progress. If we find that those most basic moral judgements haven't been beneficial to us as a whole, we should start to wonder about whether or not ensuring utility really is the point of our moral system. Alternatively, our moral system might have little benefit to us and evolve only because it benefits the memes which it is. Our whole theory of ethics, might be the result of nothing more than the continued warfare of memes for our brains. Sometimes the memes convince us to adopt them by being beneficial, sometimes they just trick us into thinking they are right, and other times they make themselves true by the mere virtue of spreading themselves. This last class of memes we can call \"self-proving memes\" and it is this class of memes that the hypotheses above suggests the fearing and hating pedophiles meme belongs to. If that hypotheses is falsified by any of the suggested experiments or any other applicable experiment, we should still consider that the hypothesis has never even been suggested outside this text. Is this more likely because the hypotheses is so stupid, or because it is so rooted in us not to question such simple facts?</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "ZZzWYFi3hpiXxc27j", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 24, "baseScore": 2, "extendedScore": null, "score": 4e-06, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "8045", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 3, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": {"html": "<p><strong id=\"Introduction__\">Introduction: </strong></p>\n<p>Today there is an almost universal prejudice against individuals with a certain sexual orientation.

The only difference is the adults intention, which children, or at least infants, are largely insensitive to. What then is the justification for not allowing pedophiles to come to our houses and have our infants reach out and grab their genitals as our infant's instincts would have them do?</p>\n<p>It could be argued that children might be traumatized simply by being forced to do something that they do not want to do, and that is certainly likely. But does that mean that we should allow our children to be involved in sexual acts with adults if they are consenting? If we were to argue that children cannot consent, then we would have to ask \"can they be non-consenting?\" What we generally mean by saying that \"children cannot consent.\" is that they can't consent responsibly because they lack the information to do so. This is granted, but they can simply consent. Children can be made to be the main actors in cases of molestation and even consensual sex. Again, at the risk of being far to graphic: it is not uncommon for one child to molest another, nor is it uncommon for young friends of the same gender to naively engage in games of a sexual nature. Even in the case of molestation from an adult to an infant: if the adult presents his/her genitals the infant will naturally grab. How this grabbing is to be distinguished by the infant from the thousands of other skin covered objects that he/she will grab through out his/her life remains a mystery to me.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Hypotheses_\">Hypotheses:</strong></p>\n<p>Infants and children are not designed by evolution to avoid being involved in non-painful forms of sexual encounters which they are willing participants in. By \"willing participant\" all that is meant is not being forced to engage in the sexual act. The trauma that often follows sexual encounters with adults for children is caused by the reactions of the children's parents. There would be no trauma in the children if the parents and other role-models of said children saw sex with children as a routine part of growing up.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Experiments_to_Falsify_\">Experiments to Falsify:</strong></p>\n<p>(1): Take two appropriately large and randomized samples of infants and children. Have the control monitored by a brain imaging device while cleaned by their parents. Have the variable do the same only have researchers dressed in normal clothes do the cleaning as opposed to the parents. If there is a difference observed in the neurological behavior of these two groups which is larger than the difference between a group of children that are simply looking at their parents and looking at strangers, then there is likely a mechanism from birth which identifies sexual acts. All subjects must be sufficiently young so as to have no learned association with their genitals and sex.</p>\n<p>(2): Find a closed population which has no concept of sex as a demonized act or of children as being too young to have sex with. Determine this by extensive interviews with the adult population designed to get them to be contradictory. After finding this population if it exists, show that the stability of those children which were involved in non-painful sexual acts with adults is lower than those children which were not involved. If this is accomplished it will suggest that the behaviors of parents of victims of molestation is not the source of the trauma caused in children after being molested.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Experiments_to_Verify_\">Experiments to Verify:</strong></p>\n<p>(1): Setup the same control and variable as in (1) above. If we get the result that there is no significant difference between the neurological behavior of the control and the variable, then it becomes less likely that there is anything in children which allows them to tell the difference between non-painful acts of molestation, and cleaning of the genitals.</p>\n<p>(2): Find a population as described in (2). Show that those individuals which engaged in sexual acts at a young age have no lower stability than those which did not.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"A_Meme_not_a_Gene_\">A Meme not a Gene:</strong></p>\n<p>If molestation is not inherently traumatic, why do we feel the need to protect our children from it? There are many possible reasons, but one of the most biological might be our jealousy. We are built to not let others have sex with loved ones, yes. But are we really biologically built to not let others have sex with our children? It'd be a strange adaptation to say the least. Why have children, and prevent them from reproducing? It might well be a side-effect of our evolved jealously.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But more seems to be at play here then a confusion of jealousy. As my evidence for this I propose that you recall how salacious and downright offensive you found it when I mentioned that an infant would instinctively grab a genital if presented. It doesn't have to be your own infant in your mind to be repulsed by imagining the situation. It is a repulsive situation to imagine for almost anyone I have met that is not a pedophile, and even most pedophiles. If it is not our child we're imagining, just some random token child, and it is just some token child molester we are imagining, the image still repulses us greatly, which suggests that it does not come from biological design since our genetic fitness is not at all increased by worrying about the children of others.</p>\n<p>We likely started demonizing pedophiles well after the development of language if the hypothesis stated above is correct. If trauma isn't caused in children from sexual acts with adults before learning about the taboo nature of sex, then it is likely the taboo nature of sex that causes such events to be traumatic. But sex is not taboo because of our genetic history, sex is taboo because of our memtic history.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Why_the_Meme_is_such_a_Success__Imagining_Patient_Zero___\">Why the Meme is such a Success (Imagining Patient Zero): </strong></p>\n<p>Let's imagine a hypothetical culture which has demonized sex but doesn't really have an accepted attitude towards pedophiles. Suppose one parent catches another adult engaged in sexual behavior with his/her children. The parent, confused by and scared of sexual action, quickly pulls away the child while attacking the other adult and tells the child that he/she is not to do that anymore or go near that person. The child reacts negatively to this, now knowing that sex is demonic. We have all seen this sort of behavior before, if a child bumps his head and his/her parents say \"Oh that's ok, come on, we gotta get going.\" in a lovely mommy voice the child is more likely to get up and keep on trucking. But if the parents react with \"Oh God! Grab the ice pack, grab the ice pack!\" yelling urgently, the child cries and may well act is if he/she is much more hurt than he/she really is.</p>\n<p>When this hypothetical parent next sees his/her fellow parent friends he/she tells them of the event and how horrific it was for him/her, and how traumatic it was for his/her child. The other parents then warn their children of the strange man/woman that lured the first child and tell their own children never to go near that man/woman's house. The children of course need to find out why for themselves and go there anyway. Another child gets involved in acts of a sexual nature with the town pedophile. This catches the attention of a passerby, who by now knows of what goes on in that house, and how evil it is. This passerby alerts the others that it is happening again. At this point the town decides to do something about it. They lynch the pedophile. This becomes the talk of the town and of the local ruling government body.</p>\n<p>Now all of the adults in the town know how to react to pedophilia: as if it would be a demonizing traumatic event for their children. Acting as such when one of their children is inevitably molested, causes that child to find it traumatic. News of the trauma it caused to the child spreads and the whole process is repeated, strengthening the believe that children become traumatized when molested.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This thought experiment is likely not very much like what really happened to produce this meme in the first place. To actually understand how that happened we would have to trace the memetic evolution of our ancestors for much further than we have the ability to do now. But this hypothetical does at least give us a way of imagining how a belief like \"Sexual acts with children and adults causes trauma in the children involved.\" might start off false and become <em>truer</em> as it becomes more widely accepted, and more widely accepted as it becomes <em>truer</em>. In the end holding that belief is going to cause more suffering in our children than if we didn't hold it provided the hypothesis above is correct. But we believe it anyway, and our moral judgements stray that way anyway, regardless of whether or not we have any benefit from the belief.</p>\n<p>The true benefactor here is the meme itself. The meme of fearing and hating pedophiles need not be useful for us as a species, it needs only to be good at getting itself spread. Luckily for the meme, as it gets itself spread the belief associated with it becomes truer. This meme has a belief built in that is a self-fulfilling prophecy so that the more widespread the meme becomes the better its chances of replicating. It's a feedback loop, the meme predisposes us to act a certain way towards molested children, acting towards molested children this way makes them find the event traumatic, the observed trauma of the molested children enforces the meme.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Conclusion_\">Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>We can and do hold very basic moral attitudes as a culture which are completely unexamined. Even the most basic moral judgements that we make, like \"pedophilia is wrong\" are not on as firm of footing as we would like to believe them to be. But when we sharpen the issue and we are faced with the bluntness of the situation, things can become even more difficult. Our biases are very firmly rooted in us. Even I, who will tell you that I'm on the fence about the utility of demonizing pedophilia, am absolutely repulsed and ethically offended upon the thought of such an act. But I consider it important that we think sharply about the utility involved in such basic and unquestioned moral judgements and report our progress. If we find that those most basic moral judgements haven't been beneficial to us as a whole, we should start to wonder about whether or not ensuring utility really is the point of our moral system. Alternatively, our moral system might have little benefit to us and evolve only because it benefits the memes which it is. Our whole theory of ethics, might be the result of nothing more than the continued warfare of memes for our brains. Sometimes the memes convince us to adopt them by being beneficial, sometimes they just trick us into thinking they are right, and other times they make themselves true by the mere virtue of spreading themselves. This last class of memes we can call \"self-proving memes\" and it is this class of memes that the hypotheses above suggests the fearing and hating pedophiles meme belongs to. If that hypotheses is falsified by any of the suggested experiments or any other applicable experiment, we should still consider that the hypothesis has never even been suggested outside this text. Is this more likely because the hypotheses is so stupid, or because it is so rooted in us not to question such simple facts?</p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction: ", "anchor":

rationality in policy making: at the individual level, but also how we can build systems (in terms of requirements during policy creation, creation of independent bodies, incentive structures for officials/ministers&hellip;) that encourage more rational policies. This is the context for the stuff below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I recently went to a talk on the use of trial and error in policy making. It was hosted by the Institute for Government (a non-political think tank advising ministers and civil servants on good government), and included the Undercover Economist, Tim Harford. <span>&nbsp;</span>Details including a recording can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/our-events/105/government-by-trial-and-error-a-discussion-with-tim-harford\">http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/our-events/105/government-by-trial-and-error-a-discussion-with-tim-harford</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ben Goldacre was also attending in the audience, and has written about this: <a href=\"http://www.badscience.net/2011/05/we-should-so-blatantly-do-more-randomised-trials-on-policy/\">http://www.badscience.net/2011/05/we-should-so-blatantly-do-more-randomised-trials-on-policy/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The basic message of the talk was that much of policy could benefit from being trialled more effectively, whether in the form of formalised, controlled trials: following the medical example inasmuch as that is practically possible.<span>&nbsp; </span>This approach seems to be being seriously considered by this government in several areas: one example of how it might work in theory can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.straightstatistics.org/article/what-works-criminal-justice-time-find-out\">http://www.straightstatistics.org/article/what-works-criminal-justice-time-find-out</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, the reality is often messier, and ministers are looking for both swifter results and more security. Other forms of &lsquo;experimentation&rsquo; involve devolving power to local councils (Localism Bill) or schools (Free Schools) etc. In these cases there aren&rsquo;t the same formal comparison methods but you at least get lots of ideas and some ability to judge which ones have gone well. An underlying issue is the quality of assessments: a policy that has clear criteria for appraisal built into its design will be much easier to judge, whereas one that is simply acted upon and studied later might suffer from poor evidence and be more open to being interpreted in line with preconcieved or desired outcomes.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A final approach is &lsquo;payment by results&rsquo;, where tasks such as preventing reoffending or getting people off drugs is paid for on the basis of successes achieved rather than services delivered, the idea being that this provides a fiscal incentive to get it right. A critical view of one such scheme is here</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.straightstatistics.org/article/flaws-mojs-reoffending-study\">http://www.straightstatistics.org/article/flaws-mojs-reoffending-study</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I was wondering what people here felt about the idea of trial-and-error in policy. I think it seems like a good idea, with the following limitations</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"text-indent: -18pt;\"><span><span>-<span style=\"font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>a) some policies probably can&rsquo;t be trialled on a national scale (can you have half the country making cuts while the other half keeps spending?)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18pt;\"><span><span>-<span style=\"font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>b) some cases will have ethical issues as with medicine</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18pt;\"><span><span>-<span style=\"font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>c) some cases might not allow clear-cut results, eliminating the ability to learn and simply creating a chaotic mess of different approaches</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"text-indent: -18pt;\"><span><span>-<span style=\"font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>d) the biggy: I don&rsquo;t know if the political culture is open to it.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any thoughts?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false,

numbers that seems to be inductively verifiable, but is a general recursive decision problem, provided your sample is large enough?\" Simply, if we define a binary property 'P' that can only be tested by algorithms that might not halt, and show, say by computation, that every natural number up to some arbitrarily large number 'N' has the property P, does that mean that there must be a generalized deductive proof that for all natural numbers P holds?</p>\n<p>How big can N get before there must be a deductive proof that P holds for all natural numbers? What if N was larger than Graham's number[1]?&nbsp; What if we showed thousands of years from now--using computers that are unimaginably strong by today's standards--that every number less than or equal to the number you get when you put Graham's number as both of the inputs to the Ackermann function[2] has a property P. But they still have no generalized deductive proof that all numbers have P, is that enough for these future number theorists to state that it is a scientific fact that all natural numbers have the property P?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may seem impossible for such a disagreement to come up between induction and deduction, but we are already at a similar (though admittedly less dramatic) impasse. The disagreement centers around the Collatz conjecture, which states that every number is a Collatz number. To test if some number n is a Collatz number,<em>&nbsp;</em> if <em>n</em> is even, divide it by 2 to get <em>n</em> / 2, if <em>n</em> is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3<em>n</em> + 1, and repeat this process with the new number thus obtained, indefinitely, if you eventually reach the cycle 4, 2, 1, then n is a Collatz number. Every number up to 20 &times; 2^58 has been shown to be a Collatz number[3], and it has been shown that there are no cycles with a smaller period than 35400[4], yet there is still no deductive proof of the Collatz conjecture[5]. In fact, one method of generalized proof has already been shown to be undecidable[6]. If it was shown that no general proof could ever be found, but all numbers up to the unimaginably large ones described above were shown to be Collatz numbers, what epistemological status should we grant the conjecture?</p>\n<p>It has been made clear by the history of mathematics that a lack of small counterexamples to a conjecture of the form \"for all natural numbers P(<em>n</em>) = 1\" where 'P' is a binary function (let's call this an \"inductive-conjecture\"), is not at all a proof of that conjecture. There have been many inductive-conjectures with that sort of evidence in their favor that have later been shown not to be theorems, just because the counter examples were very large. But what if a proof of the undecidability of a conjecture of that form is given, what then if no counter example had been found up to the insanely large values described above?</p>\n<p>If there is a binary property 'R' that holds for all natural numbers, i.e., there is no counter example, and it can be deductively shown that no proof of 'R' holding for all natural numbers exists, then the implications for epistemology, ontology and the scientific/rational endeavor in general are huge. If some facts about the natural numbers don't follow from the application of valid inferences onto axiom and theorems, then what makes us think that all the facts about the natural world must follow from natural laws in combination with the initial state of the universe? If there is such a property, then that means that in a completely deterministic system where you have all the rules describing all the possible ways that things can change, and you have all the rest of the formally verifiable information about the system, there still might be some fact about this system which is true but does not follow from those rules. Those statements would only be <em>verifiable</em> by finite probabilistic sampling from an infinite population with an undetermined standard deviation, but still be true facts. Our crowning example of such a system would of course be the theory of the natural numbers itself if such a binary property were discovered. Suppose the Collatz conjecture were shown to be undecidable, that would mean that there is no counter example, i.e., all numbers are Collatz numbers (since the existence of a counter example would guarantee the conjecture's decidability), but there would also be no generalized proof that no counter example exists (since the existence of such a proof would guarantee the decidability of the conjecture). So since we can't verify the conjecture either way, should we call it meaningless/unverifiable? Or is logically undecidable somehow distinct from literally meaningless? What restrictions/expectations should we have if we believe that an inductive-conjecture is undecidable, and how would those restrictions change if we believed that conjecture was actually unverifiable.</p>\n<p>Let's call the claim that \"there is a binary property R which holds for all natural numbers and that there is no counter example that can or will ever be found, but which also cannot be proven to hold for all natural numbers\" the \"first Potato conjecture\". How would one ever show the first potato conjecture, or even offer evidence in it's favor? Let's say we knew that some property 'R_b' held of all natural numbers that we might ever test. Then we would have a proof of this and R_b could not be our R. If we get a candidate property 'R_c'&nbsp; that isn't capable of being proven or dis-proven of all natural numbers, then we will never know if it holds for all natural numbers. Could induction even offer us any evidence in this case? Is a finite sample ever representative of an infinite population with no standard deviation even in the case of simple succession? If not, then what evidence could we ever offer for or against the potato conjecture, if an undecidable inductive-conjecture were discovered? If the answer is no evidence one way or the other, does that mean that the potato conjecture is meaningless, or just undecidable?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(But no, really, I'm asking.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham's number</a></p>\n<p>[2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function</p>\n<p>[3]: <a href=\"http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/3x%2B1.html\">http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/3x+1.html</a></p>\n<p>[4]: http://www.jstor.org/pss/2044308</p>\n<p>[5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture</p>\n<p>[6]: Quoting Lagarias 1985: \"J.

how to make AI provably friendly to us and our values (non-dangerous), before attempting to solve artificial general intelligence?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>J&uuml;rgen Schmidhuber:</strong> From a paper of mine:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">All attempts at making sure there will be only provably friendly AIs seem doomed. Once somebody posts the recipe for practically feasible self-improving Goedel machines or AIs in form of code into which one can plug arbitrary utility functions, many users will equip such AIs with many different goals, often at least partially conflicting with those of humans. The laws of physics and the availability of physical resources will eventually determine which utility functions will help their AIs more than others to multiply and become dominant in competition with AIs driven by different utility functions. Which values are \"good\"? The survivors will define this in hindsight, since only survivors promote their values.</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the current level of awareness of possible risks from AI within the artificial intelligence community, relative to the ideal level?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>J&uuml;rgen Schmidhuber:</strong> Some are interested in this, but most don't think it's relevant right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do risks from AI compare to other existential risks, e.g. advanced nanotechnology?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>J&uuml;rgen Schmidhuber:</strong> I guess AI risks are less predictable.</p>\n<p><em><strong>(In his response to my questions he also added the following.)</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>J&uuml;rgen Schmidhuber: </strong>Recursive Self-Improvement: The provably optimal way of doing this was published in 2003. From a recent survey paper:<br /><br />The fully self-referential Goedel machine [1,2] already is a universal AI that is at least theoretically optimal in a certain sense. It may interact with some initially unknown, partially observable environment to maximize future expected utility or reward by solving arbitrary user-defined computational tasks. Its initial algorithm is not hardwired; it can completely rewrite itself without essential limits apart from the limits of computability, provided a proof searcher embedded within the initial algorithm can first prove that the rewrite is useful, according to the formalized utility function taking into account the limited computational resources. Self-rewrites may modify / improve the proof searcher itself, and can be shown to be globally optimal, relative to Goedel's well-known fundamental restrictions of provability. To make sure the Goedel machine is at least asymptotically optimal even before the first self-rewrite, we may initialize it by Hutter's non-self-referential but asymptotically fastest algorithm for all well-defined problems HSEARCH [3], which uses a hardwired brute force proof searcher and (justifiably) ignores the costs of proof search. Assuming discrete input/output domains X/Y, a formal problem specification f : X -&gt; Y (say, a functional description of how integers are decomposed into their prime factors), and a particular x in X (say, an integer to be factorized), HSEARCH orders all proofs of an appropriate axiomatic system by size to find programs q that for all z in X provably compute f(z) within time bound tq(z). Simultaneously it spends most of its time on executing the q with the best currently proven time bound tq(x). Remarkably, HSEARCH is as fast as the fastest algorithm that provably computes f(z) for all z in X, save for a constant factor smaller than 1 + epsilon (arbitrary real-valued epsilon &gt; 0) and an f-specific but x-independent additive constant. Given some problem, the Goedel machine may decide to replace its HSEARCH initialization by a faster method suffering less from large constant overhead, but even if it doesn't, its performance won't be less than asymptotically optimal.<br /><br />All of this implies that there already exists the blueprint of a Universal AI which will solve almost all problems almost as quickly as if it already knew the best (unknown) algorithm for solving them, because almost all imaginable problems are big enough to make the additive constant negligible. The only motivation for not quitting computer science research right now is that many real-world problems are so small and simple that the ominous constant slowdown (potentially relevant at least before the first Goedel machine self-rewrite) is not negligible. Nevertheless, the ongoing efforts at scaling universal AIs down to the rather few small problems are very much informed by the new millennium's theoretical insights mentioned above, and may soon yield practically feasible yet still general problem solvers for physical systems with highly restricted computational power, say, a few trillion instructions per second, roughly comparable to a human brain power.<br /><br />[1] J.

Most experts I wrote haven't responded at all so far, although a few did but asked me not to publish their answers. Some of them are well-known even outside of their field of expertise and respected even here on LW.</p>\n<p>I will paraphrase some of the responses I got below:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Anonymous expert 01:</strong> I think the so-called Singularity is unlikely to come about in the foreseeable future. I already know about the SIAI and I think that the people who are involved with it are well-meaning, thoughtful and highly intelligent. But I personally think that they are na&iuml;ve as far as the nature of human intelligence goes. None of them seems to have a realistic picture about the nature of thinking.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Anonymous expert 02:</strong> My opinion is that some people hold much stronger opinions on this issue than justified by our current state of knowledge.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Anonymous expert 03: </strong>I believe that the biggest risk from AI is<strong> </strong>that at some point we will become so dependent on it that we lose our cognitive abilities.<strong> </strong>Today people are losing their ability to navigate with maps, thanks to GPS. But such a loss will be nothing compared to what we might lose by letting AI solve more important problems for us.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Anonymous expert 04:&nbsp; </strong>I think these are nontrivial questions and that risks from AI have to be taken seriously. But I also believe that many people have made scary-sounding but mostly unfounded speculations. In principle an AI could take over the world, but currently AI presents no threat. At some point, it will become a more pressing issue. In the mean time, we are much more likely to destroy ourselves by other means.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform":

its way up to massive superhuman intelligence within a matter of hours or days?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber:</strong> High for the next few decades, mostly because some of our own work seems to be almost there:</p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n<li>G\u00f6del machine: <a

how to make AI provably friendly to us and our values (non-dangerous), before attempting to solve artificial general intelligence?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber:</strong> From a paper of mine:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">All attempts at making sure there will be only provably friendly AIs seem doomed. Once somebody posts the recipe for practically feasible self-improving Goedel machines or AIs in form of code into which one can plug arbitrary utility functions, many users will equip such AIs with many different goals, often at least partially conflicting with those of humans. The laws of physics and the availability of physical resources will eventually determine which utility functions will help their AIs more than others to multiply and become dominant in competition with AIs driven by different utility functions. Which values are \"good\"? The survivors will define this in hindsight, since only survivors promote their values.</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the current level of awareness of possible risks from AI within the artificial intelligence community, relative to the ideal level?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber:</strong> Some are interested in this, but most don't think it's relevant right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do risks from AI compare to other existential risks, e.g. advanced nanotechnology?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber:</strong> I guess AI risks are less predictable.</p>\n<p><em><strong>(In his response to my questions he also added the following.)</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber: </strong>Recursive Self-Improvement: The provably optimal way of doing this was published in 2003. From a recent survey paper:<br><br>The fully self-referential Goedel machine [1,2] already is a universal AI that is at least theoretically optimal in a certain sense. It may interact with some initially unknown, partially observable environment to maximize future expected utility or reward by solving arbitrary user-defined computational tasks. Its initial algorithm is not hardwired; it can completely rewrite itself without essential limits apart from the limits of computability, provided a proof searcher embedded within the initial algorithm can first prove that the rewrite is useful, according to the formalized utility function taking into account the limited computational resources. Self-rewrites may modify / improve the proof searcher itself, and can be shown to be globally optimal, relative to Goedel's well-known fundamental restrictions of provability. To make sure the Goedel machine is at least asymptotically optimal even before the first self-rewrite, we may initialize it by Hutter's non-self-referential but asymptotically fastest algorithm for all well-defined problems HSEARCH [3], which uses a hardwired brute force proof searcher and (justifiably) ignores the costs of proof search. Assuming discrete input/output domains X/Y, a formal problem specification f : X -&gt; Y (say, a functional description of how integers are decomposed into their prime factors), and a particular x in X (say, an integer to be factorized), HSEARCH orders all proofs of an appropriate axiomatic system by size to find programs q that for all z in X provably compute f(z) within time bound tq(z). Simultaneously it spends most of its time on executing the q with the best currently proven time bound tq(x). Remarkably, HSEARCH is as fast as the fastest algorithm that provably computes f(z) for all z in X, save for a constant factor smaller than 1 + epsilon (arbitrary real-valued epsilon &gt; 0) and an f-specific but x-independent additive constant. Given some problem, the Goedel machine may decide to replace its HSEARCH initialization by a faster method suffering less from large constant overhead, but even if it doesn't, its performance won't be less than asymptotically optimal.<br><br>All of this implies that there already exists the blueprint of a Universal AI which will solve almost all problems almost as quickly as if it already knew the best (unknown) algorithm for solving them, because almost all imaginable problems are big enough to make the additive constant negligible. The only motivation for not quitting computer science research right now is that many real-world problems are so small and simple that the ominous constant slowdown (potentially relevant at least before the first Goedel machine self-rewrite) is not negligible. Nevertheless, the ongoing efforts at scaling universal AIs down to the rather few small problems are very much informed by the new millennium's theoretical insights mentioned above, and may soon yield practically feasible yet still general problem solvers for physical systems with highly restricted computational power, say, a few trillion instructions per second, roughly comparable to a human brain power.<br><br>[1] J.

Most experts I wrote haven't responded at all so far, although a few did but asked me not to publish their answers. Some of them are well-known even outside of their field of expertise and respected even here on LW.</p>\n<p>I will paraphrase some of the responses I got below:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Anonymous expert 01:</strong> I think the so-called Singularity is unlikely to come about in the foreseeable future. I already know about the SIAI and I think that the people who are involved with it are well-meaning, thoughtful and highly intelligent. But I personally think that they are na\u00efve as far as the nature of human intelligence goes. None of them seems to have a realistic picture about the nature of thinking.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Anonymous expert 02:</strong> My opinion is that some people hold much stronger opinions on this issue than justified by our current state of knowledge.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Anonymous expert 03: </strong>I believe that the biggest risk from AI is<strong> </strong>that at some point we will become so dependent on it that we lose our cognitive abilities.<strong> </strong>Today people are losing their ability to navigate with maps, thanks to GPS. But such a loss will be nothing compared to what we might lose by letting AI solve more important problems for us.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Anonymous expert 04:&nbsp; </strong>I think these are nontrivial questions and that risks from AI have to be taken seriously. But I also believe that many people have made scary-sounding but mostly unfounded speculations. In principle an AI could take over the world, but currently AI presents no threat. At some point, it will become a more pressing issue. In the mean time, we are much more likely to destroy ourselves by other means.</p>", "sections": [{"title": "[Click here to see a list of all interviews]", "anchor": "_Click_here_to_see_a_list_of_all_interviews_", "level": 2}, {"title": "The Interview:", "anchor": "The_Interview_", "level": 1}, {"title": "Anonymous", "anchor": "Anonymous", "level": 1}, {"divider": true, "level": 0, "anchor": "postHeadingsDivider"}, {"anchor": "comments", "level": 0, "title": "45 comments"}], "headingsCount": 5}, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 45, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 5, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-06-15T19:52:48.620Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "Out of the closet as a Positive Utilitarian", "slug": "out-of-the-closet-as-a-positive-utilitarian", "viewCount": null, "lastCommentedAt": "2017-06-17T04:19:38.020Z", "clickCount": null, "deletedDraft": false, "status": 2, "isFuture": false, "sticky": false, "stickyPriority": 2, "userIP": null, "userAgent": null, "referrer": null, "author": null, "user": {"username": "diegocaleiro", "createdAt": "2009-07-27T10:36:18.861Z", "isAdmin": false, "displayName": "diegocaleiro"}, "userId": "6tTwQ8Rdp2uhK5NL3", "domain": null, "pageUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KqLLPh68DuXyisjRo/out-of-the-closet-as-a-positive-utilitarian", "pageUrlRelative": "/posts/KqLLPh68DuXyisjRo/out-of-the-closet-as-a-positive-utilitarian", "linkUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KqLLPh68DuXyisjRo/out-of-the-closet-as-a-positive-utilitarian", "postedAtFormatted": "Wednesday, June 15th 2011", "emailShareUrl": "mailto:?subject=Interesting%20link%3A%20Out%20of%20the%20closet%20as%20a%20Positive%20Utilitarian&body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20find%20this%20interesting%3A%0A%0AOut%20of%20the%20closet%20as%20a%20Positive%20Utilitarian%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FKqLLPh68DuXyisjRo%2Fout-of-the-closet-as-a-positive-utilitarian%0A%0A(found%20via%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com)%0A%20%20", "twitterShareUrl": "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Out%20of%20the%20closet%20as%20a%20Positive%20Utilitarian%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FKqLLPh68DuXyisjRo%2Fout-of-the-closet-as-a-positive-utilitarian", "facebookShareUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FKqLLPh68DuXyisjRo%2Fout-of-the-closet-as-a-positive-utilitarian", "socialPreviewImageUrl": "", "question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 1246, "htmlBody": "<p><!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } --></p>\n<blockquote class=\"western\" style=\"text-align: right\">Knowledge of what is possible is the beginning of happiness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"western\" style=\"text-align: right\">- George Santayana</blockquote>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Edit: It seems as though people who read this were thinking that I was defending Positive Utilitarianism. This is not at all my intention. I am just suggesting that the class <em>exists</em>, and that it should be OK to express oneself as part of it. It is obviously better to be both a positive and a negative utilitarian than just a positive one. If that was not clear, I hope it is now. My point was just that if someone wanted to be sure that she is an utilitarian before doing some action, but was not feeling confortable because she was actually just a positive utilitarian, now that person would feel the relief that someone else felt the same, and could go about trying to make the world a better place without worrying about lone bystander bias.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">It is only in unusual occasions that I find myself as compatible with a label. Back in my wild and reckless youth, I have probably encountered only those memes as acceptably labelling me: Transhumanist, Polyamorist, Immortalist, Extrovert. &nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">That was it. No political position, no sexual orientation, no teen affiliation, no ethnicity, no nationality, no soccer team, no dress code. No religion.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">There are very few one-word things that I feel like I am.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Then along came Utilitarianism. We were presented by transhumanism, and got along somewhat well, I would check out its origins, who was into it as a philosophy, and we seemed to be thinking in the same general direction.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Once we had some problems with regards to vehicles. We call those the <a title=\"Trolley problem, Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\" target=\"_blank\">trolley problems</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">From then on I <em>slowly</em> met many transhumanists (keep in mind that I live in Brazil), and in general would identify instantaneously. That did not happen with utilitarians. There was something to utilitarianism that just didn't work for me.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Yesterday, I finally had the sudden realization. It was negative utilitarianism. Everyone these days is a negative utilitarian. They may have come from many realms into utilitarianism (preference or hedonistic, doesn't matter) but eventually they notice that suffering is really really bad and start to think that they ought to do something about it. Some set course towards diminishing it, and I wish them Godspeed. Yet I could not acquiesce in their beliefs, rejoice in their conquests, celebrate their pursuals.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">It is arguable, and has been extensively argued, that negative utilitarianism may be a more ethical approach, during our non posthuman times, than it's positive counterpart. This is correct.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">Enters Santayana, \"Knowledge of what is possible is the beginning of happiness.\" <!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } --></p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm\">and also one of few philosophical agreements of the millennia &ldquo;Ought implies can&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm\">I don't feel good thinking about suffering. I don't like suffering, I don't spontaneously wake up every morning and visit a hospital. I never try to check out what is going on in the nearest slum to see if someone died, and in fact, I don't even read the newspaper, which strikes me as a lot of ephemeral sad information about the things that went so wrong the last fews days that people are willing to read about it. I bet you like horror/suspense movies, I don't.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm\">It doesn't really matter if you are talking about diminishing suffering, relieving pain, decreasing poverty or striking misery. When I read sentences like the previous one, I read &ldquo; It doesn't really matter if <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">you are talking about</span> diminishing <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">suffering</span>, relieving <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">pain,</span> decreasing <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">poverty</span> or striking <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">misery.</span>&rdquo; My brain just doesn't get around this and I don't want it to.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm\">So I finally made peace with it, and would like to go out of the closet now:</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm\">Folks, I am a Positive Utilitarian!</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm\">For the past several years I have understood evolutionary psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and read 7 books on happiness because I really care about making other people happy. I've been promoting happiness ever since school time and, like the NY less wrong group, I've optimized for fun around me as much as I could (some day I'll write a post about effective group-happiness increasing techniques, but this is not that day). What attracted me to transhumanism was not how it would cure disease, solve starvation, but it's motto: Better than well. One of the things that caused most shock in my self presentations to the people of the Singularity institute was when I said: I am more of a transhumanist then a singularitarian. Now I know what that meant, it meant that I don't have a barrier against thinking about &ldquo;better than well&rdquo; but I do have a barrier against &ldquo;before someone does it and destroys life as we know it&rdquo;. This of course, sums up perfectly with the fact that I have rejected joining the <a title=\"X-Risk Network Post\" href=\"/lw/4lg/existential_risk_reduction_career_network\" target=\"_blank\">X-risk network</a> launched here in Less Wrong</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">Positive Utilitarianism is not a position I am arguing for within Utilitarianism, please don't abandon the children suffering. But I would like to argue that it is OK in the broad picture of things. It is much better than the vast majority of ethical choices humans make, and probably better than personal hedonism. It is about maximizing the happiness of everyone, near or far, for as long as possible, with most of our strenghts. In the case of Positive Preference Utilitarianism, make that everyone's preferences.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">Positive Utilitarianism is not <em>the</em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> most ethical position a person can take, and one can see it as a consequence of egocentric utilitarianism, if it is the case that a person became a positive utilitarian because they value their hedons and utilons more than other people's. Sometimes it just is the case that they feel better surrounded by awesomeness and happiness than by civil war, disease and crying innocents, thus their higher value attribution for self-utilons will generate positive utilitarianism.</span></p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">There are others out there that are like me, that are very strongly cognitively wired against ever letting themselves into <a title=\"John Coffey is Tired of evil in the Green Mile\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScHhuIY4Pwo&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">this situation</a>(1 min video). Maybe they have engineered their world to be a happy bubble, or otherwise controlled the environment in such ways. Maybe experienced trauma related to suffering, or just can't stand thinking about it.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">But if still committed to make the world a better place by the most effective means possible, why are we still hiding? It just so happens that our conditions of emotional possibility are a little different.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">Let us abandon our Christian origins and not set the threshold for greatness so high that only the ascetic can be thought of as good.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">If you have like me in the past postponed action because there was this internal itch that didn't let you feel comfortable as an utilitarian, call yourself a positive utilitarian, and hold your tools no longer. Open that closet, get comfortable with those awesome negative utilitarians around you and whole heartedly remark: I am a Positive Utilitarian.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">It is OK.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Edit: Nisan asked some things for positive utilitarians to do, and it seemed good to put them here -</p>\n<p>Write Life-advice kinds of books, in Ferriss/AJ Jacobs style.&nbsp; Create a Transhumanist Institution to transform Rationalists into Utilitarians into Transhumanists. Organize complex engaging events on facebook for friends that would cause happiness that would not have happened otherwise. Make a lot of people laugh in a conference. Read many books on happiness, and upon request, give people data on how to be happy (count blessings twice a week, force smiles when bored, write 300 words thank you notes and read them outloud, wear botox, etc...)

seriously question the soundness of the final section of this post. More on this at the end of the post.</em></p>\n<p>Consider the following two approaches to philanthropy:</p>\n<p>The &ldquo;local&rdquo; approach (associated with \"satisficing\") is to consider those philanthropic opportunities that are \"close to oneself\" in some sense (immediately salient, within one's own communities, in one's domains of expertise). The &ldquo;global&rdquo; approach (associated with \"maximizing\") is to survey the philanthropic landscape, search for the best philanthropic opportunities in absolute terms, and devote oneself to those.</p>\n<p>In practice nobody's approach to philanthropy is genuinely entirely global; one is necessarily limited by the fact that the range of possibilities that are salient to oneself is smaller than the total range of possibilities and by the fact that one has limited computational power. But there is nevertheless substantial variation in the degree to which individuals' approaches to philanthropy are global or local.</p>\n<p>Here I'll compare the pros and cons of the local approach and the global approach and attempt to arrive at some sort of synthesis of the two.</p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: I volunteer for GiveWell and may work for them in the future.</em></p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>In favor of the local approach to philanthropy: </strong></p>\n<p>1. One problem with the global approach to philanthropy is that it often leads to reasoning about and/or designing approaches to&nbsp; problems in domains that one knows little about. According to a <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/06/04/the-challenge-of-local-ownership/\">June 2009 GiveWell blog entry</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the consistent refrains we&rsquo;ve seen in aid literature is the importance of local participation/enthusiasm/ownership for aid projects. Many programs have been criticized for being too &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; (i.e., imposing outsiders&rsquo; designs on local communities), with the implication that more &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; programs (i.e., getting local people to participate in the design of execution of programs) would be more likely to create real and lasting change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All else being equal, one has a better chance of succeeding at a philanthropic effort in a domain where one has expertise and familiarity with the relevant issues than one does in a domain where this is not the case. Moreover, the prospect of <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1066983.html\">doing more harm than good</a> are heightened in the latter case.</p>\n<p>2. The search time involved in the local approach is much smaller than the search time involved in the global approach. In the local approach one simply makes a choice out of the salient options. In the global approach one is led to sort through millions of philanthropic efforts that one can engage in and attempt to gauge their efficacy against one another. Whatever time one spends searching could be spent directly pursuing a philanthropic effort, so there is an opportunity cost to the global approach.</p>\n<p>3. As referenced in the introduction, humans lack the knowledge and computational resources necessary to do a good job at maximizing globally in a domain as a complicated as philanthropy. In the limit, as one's understanding of the world as a system goes to zero, one's philanthropic effort have a tendency to become randomly distributed in the space of expected utilities. By way of contrast it seems likely that assuming a Solomonoff prior, if everybody did what looked like a good idea locally then even in the absence of understanding world as a whole, the collected expected utility of their actions would be positive.</p>\n<p>4. Under certain assumptions the local approach solves coordination problems that the global approach leaves unsolved. If everybody works in their respective corner to make the world a better place then they are likely to notice with the other people who are working on similar efforts and communicate with them and so are better able to coordinate to reduce duplicated labor. If one adopts the global approach to philanthropy then one is more likely to be working on problems where one doesn't know the other parties that are working on it and this can lead to duplicated labor. For an extreme example, suppose that there are a million people and for each i, the i'th person can generate 1 util by completing task A_i or complete task B which generates 100 utils. If each person tries to complete task B and it only needs to be done once then the total utility of their actions is 10<sup>2 </sup>rather than the 10<sup>6</sup> that it could have been had they been optimizing locally.</p>\n<p>In the for-profit world the coordination problem is solved by the market mechanism; one should not forget that there is no natural mechanism for solving the coordination problem in the non-profit world.</p>\n<p>5. One tends to get more personal satisfaction from working on a cause that one knows well and feels good about working on than from a cause which is quite removed from one's domains of expertise. This comes partially from greater certainty of the value of one's work and partially from <a href=\"/lw/1kr/that_other_kind_of_status/\">that other kind of status</a> - the confidence that comes from feeling knowledgeable. Deriving personal satisfaction from working on a philanthropic cause allows one to devote more to it than one otherwise would be able to; I would guess that in some cases the additional amount that one can put into the cause is more than an order of magnitude more. This is in some measure true for some people even if one is donating funds and is not <em>directly</em> involved in a given project.</p>\n<p><strong>In favor of the global approach to philanthropy: </strong></p>\n<p>The argument in favor of global philanthropy is that philanthropic efforts differ in cost-effectiveness by many orders of magnitude. For example, in <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas\">your dollar goes further overseas</a> the GiveWell staff wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We understand the sentiment that \"charity starts at home,\" and we used to agree with it, until we learned just how different U.S. charity is from charity aimed at the poorest people in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and gives some discussion together with a rough comparison of cost-effectiveness of international health aid with certain domestic efforts. Though I have (marginally) more familiarity with underprivileged inner city youth than with life in sub-Saharan Africa, it seems that despite the fact that I don't know about life in sub-Saharan Africa and despite the problems with the global approach to philanthropy that I mentioned above, it's still more cost-effective to donate to international health aid efforts than to donate improve the lives of underprivileged inner city youth because the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/11/27/poor-in-the-us-rich/\">Poor in the US = Rich</a> (relatively speaking) and so at the margin sub-Saharan Africans can benefit far more from philanthropy than the poor in the US.</p>\n<p>A domain where the potential upside is many orders of magnitude greater than in the domain of international health aid is that of <a href=\"http://www.existentialrisk.com/\">existential risk reduction</a>. Here I have much less familiarity with the issues than I do with international health aid efforts because there has been less research into international aid than there has been in existential risk reduction and because the causal web influencing existential risk is very complex. Nevertheless, despite the problems with a global approach to philanthropy that I mentioned above, I feel that the potential upside of averting existential risk is sufficiently great so that existential risk reduction is the cause that deserves my <a href=\"/lw/6z/purchase_fuzzies_and_utilons_separately/\">utilon-oriented</a> philanthropic efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>A local approach within a global approach to philanthropy<br /></strong></p>\n<p>In a recent comment <a href=\"/lw/673/model_uncertainty_pascalian_reasoning_and/4crc\">Carl Shulman wrote</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fermi calculations like the one in your post can easily show the strong total utilitarian case (that is, the case within the particular framework of total utilitarianism) for focus on existential risk, but showing that a highly specific \"course of action\" addressing a specific risk is better than alternative ways to reduce existential risk is not robust to shifts of many orders of magnitude in probability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My intuition here is the same as Carl's. Combining the points in the above two sections of this post I would propose as a heuristic that <em>out of philanthropic courses of action that plausibly reduce existential risk, one should pursue those that one is most knowledgeable about, interested in, and competent to address</em>.</p>\n<p>This is only a heuristic; one can easily imagine that the cost-effectiveness of one existential risk reduction effort decisively swamps that of another by enough orders of magnitude so that the considerations mentioned in the <strong>In favor of the local approach to philanthropy</strong> are rendered moot. If this is the case then it would be natural to apply the heuristic to the collection of interventions that are within a few orders of magnitude of one another rather than existential risk reduction efforts in general.</p>\n<p>Putting the considerations under the heading <strong>In favor of the local approach to philanthropy</strong> together with the idea that there seem to be a number of existential risk reduction opportunities within a few orders of magnitude of the one with highest expected value pushes in the direction of <em>a local approach to philanthropy within a cluster of existential risk reduction efforts</em>.</p>\n<p>I presently believe that the cluster of existential risk efforts that have well-considered expected value which is within a few orders of magnitude of the one that appears to have the highest expected value is larger than it may initially seem. There are often large error bars surrounding the expected value of a given intervention on account of the model uncertainty leading to assessment of the expected value of the intervention varying heavily with new data. Averaging over such variations can place interventions of initially seemingly different cost-effectiveness in a comparable range. I will have more to say about this in a future post.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Carl suggests that the factors mentioned in<strong> In favor of the local approach to philanthropy </strong>are not sufficiently strong to shift one's philanthropic focus from one existential risk reduction method to another on altruistic grounds when the apparent expected values of the two courses of action are more than an order of magnitude different. Certainly the largest order of magnitude of existential risk reduction that one is able to affect swamps all other orders of magnitude so that one should try to get the order of magnitude right if possible.</p>\n<p>So the question at stake is really whether the effect of \"averaging over such variations\" mentioned in the previous paragraph has a sufficiently strong dampening effect to place distinct existential risk efforts within an order of magnitude of cost-effectiveness of one another.</p>\n<p>Here a relevant point is that many of the factors influencing the cost-effectiveness of existential risk reduction efforts are shared across risks. Some examples of such factors are the rate of response of technology to influx of money and talent, international governmental relationships, the likely response of politicians to existential risks due to new technology and the quality of ability to gather information.

More on this at the end of the post.</em></p>\n<p>Consider the following two approaches to philanthropy:</p>\n<p>The \u201clocal\u201d approach (associated with \"satisficing\") is to consider those philanthropic opportunities that are \"close to oneself\" in some sense (immediately salient, within one's own communities, in one's domains of expertise). The \u201cglobal\u201d approach (associated with \"maximizing\") is to survey the philanthropic landscape, search for the best philanthropic opportunities in absolute terms, and devote oneself to those.</p>\n<p>In practice nobody's approach to philanthropy is genuinely entirely global; one is necessarily limited by the fact that the range of possibilities that are salient to oneself is smaller than the total range of possibilities and by the fact that one has limited computational power. But there is nevertheless substantial variation in the degree to which individuals' approaches to philanthropy are global or local.</p>\n<p>Here I'll compare the pros and cons of the local approach and the global approach and attempt to arrive at some sort of synthesis of the two.</p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: I volunteer for GiveWell and may work for them in the future.</em></p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p><strong id=\"In_favor_of_the_local_approach_to_philanthropy__\">In favor of the local approach to philanthropy: </strong></p>\n<p>1. One problem with the global approach to philanthropy is that it often leads to reasoning about and/or designing approaches to&nbsp; problems in domains that one knows little about. According to a <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/06/04/the-challenge-of-local-ownership/\">June 2009 GiveWell blog entry</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the consistent refrains we\u2019ve seen in aid literature is the importance of local participation/enthusiasm/ownership for aid projects. Many programs have been criticized for being too \u201ctop-down\u201d (i.e., imposing outsiders\u2019 designs on local communities), with the implication that more \u201cbottom-up\u201d programs (i.e., getting local people to participate in the design of execution of programs) would be more likely to create real and lasting change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All else being equal, one has a better chance of succeeding at a philanthropic effort in a domain where one has expertise and familiarity with the relevant issues than one does in a domain where this is not the case. Moreover, the prospect of <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1066983.html\">doing more harm than good</a> are heightened in the latter case.</p>\n<p>2. The search time involved in the local approach is much smaller than the search time involved in the global approach. In the local approach one simply makes a choice out of the salient options. In the global approach one is led to sort through millions of philanthropic efforts that one can engage in and attempt to gauge their efficacy against one another. Whatever time one spends searching could be spent directly pursuing a philanthropic effort, so there is an opportunity cost to the global approach.</p>\n<p>3. As referenced in the introduction, humans lack the knowledge and computational resources necessary to do a good job at maximizing globally in a domain as a complicated as philanthropy. In the limit, as one's understanding of the world as a system goes to zero, one's philanthropic effort have a tendency to become randomly distributed in the space of expected utilities. By way of contrast it seems likely that assuming a Solomonoff prior, if everybody did what looked like a good idea locally then even in the absence of understanding world as a whole, the collected expected utility of their actions would be positive.</p>\n<p>4. Under certain assumptions the local approach solves coordination problems that the global approach leaves unsolved. If everybody works in their respective corner to make the world a better place then they are likely to notice with the other people who are working on similar efforts and communicate with them and so are better able to coordinate to reduce duplicated labor. If one adopts the global approach to philanthropy then one is more likely to be working on problems where one doesn't know the other parties that are working on it and this can lead to duplicated labor. For an extreme example, suppose that there are a million people and for each i, the i'th person can generate 1 util by completing task A_i or complete task B which generates 100 utils. If each person tries to complete task B and it only needs to be done once then the total utility of their actions is 10<sup>2 </sup>rather than the 10<sup>6</sup> that it could have been had they been optimizing locally.</p>\n<p>In the for-profit world the coordination problem is solved by the market mechanism; one should not forget that there is no natural mechanism for solving the coordination problem in the non-profit world.</p>\n<p>5. One tends to get more personal satisfaction from working on a cause that one knows well and feels good about working on than from a cause which is quite removed from one's domains of expertise. This comes partially from greater certainty of the value of one's work and partially from <a href=\"/lw/1kr/that_other_kind_of_status/\">that other kind of status</a> - the confidence that comes from feeling knowledgeable. Deriving personal satisfaction from working on a philanthropic cause allows one to devote more to it than one otherwise would be able to; I would guess that in some cases the additional amount that one can put into the cause is more than an order of magnitude more. This is in some measure true for some people even if one is donating funds and is not <em>directly</em> involved in a given project.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"In_favor_of_the_global_approach_to_philanthropy__\">In favor of the global approach to philanthropy: </strong></p>\n<p>The argument in favor of global philanthropy is that philanthropic efforts differ in cost-effectiveness by many orders of magnitude. For example, in <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas\">your dollar goes further overseas</a> the GiveWell staff wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We understand the sentiment that \"charity starts at home,\" and we used to agree with it, until we learned just how different U.S. charity is from charity aimed at the poorest people in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and gives some discussion together with a rough comparison of cost-effectiveness of international health aid with certain domestic efforts. Though I have (marginally) more familiarity with underprivileged inner city youth than with life in sub-Saharan Africa, it seems that despite the fact that I don't know about life in sub-Saharan Africa and despite the problems with the global approach to philanthropy that I mentioned above, it's still more cost-effective to donate to international health aid efforts than to donate improve the lives of underprivileged inner city youth because the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/11/27/poor-in-the-us-rich/\">Poor in the US = Rich</a> (relatively speaking) and so at the margin sub-Saharan Africans can benefit far more from philanthropy than the poor in the US.</p>\n<p>A domain where the potential upside is many orders of magnitude greater than in the domain of international health aid is that of <a href=\"http://www.existentialrisk.com/\">existential risk reduction</a>. Here I have much less familiarity with the issues than I do with international health aid efforts because there has been less research into international aid than there has been in existential risk reduction and because the causal web influencing existential risk is very complex. Nevertheless, despite the problems with a global approach to philanthropy that I mentioned above, I feel that the potential upside of averting existential risk is sufficiently great so that existential risk reduction is the cause that deserves my <a href=\"/lw/6z/purchase_fuzzies_and_utilons_separately/\">utilon-oriented</a> philanthropic efforts.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"A_local_approach_within_a_global_approach_to_philanthropy\">A local approach within a global approach to philanthropy<br></strong></p>\n<p>In a recent comment <a href=\"/lw/673/model_uncertainty_pascalian_reasoning_and/4crc\">Carl Shulman wrote</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fermi calculations like the one in your post can easily show the strong total utilitarian case (that is, the case within the particular framework of total utilitarianism) for focus on existential risk, but showing that a highly specific \"course of action\" addressing a specific risk is better than alternative ways to reduce existential risk is not robust to shifts of many orders of magnitude in probability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My intuition here is the same as Carl's. Combining the points in the above two sections of this post I would propose as a heuristic that <em>out of philanthropic courses of action that plausibly reduce existential risk, one should pursue those that one is most knowledgeable about, interested in, and competent to address</em>.</p>\n<p>This is only a heuristic; one can easily imagine that the cost-effectiveness of one existential risk reduction effort decisively swamps that of another by enough orders of magnitude so that the considerations mentioned in the <strong>In favor of the local approach to philanthropy</strong> are rendered moot. If this is the case then it would be natural to apply the heuristic to the collection of interventions that are within a few orders of magnitude of one another rather than existential risk reduction efforts in general.</p>\n<p>Putting the considerations under the heading <strong>In favor of the local approach to philanthropy</strong> together with the idea that there seem to be a number of existential risk reduction opportunities within a few orders of magnitude of the one with highest expected value pushes in the direction of <em>a local approach to philanthropy within a cluster of existential risk reduction efforts</em>.</p>\n<p>I presently believe that the cluster of existential risk efforts that have well-considered expected value which is within a few orders of magnitude of the one that appears to have the highest expected value is larger than it may initially seem. There are often large error bars surrounding the expected value of a given intervention on account of the model uncertainty leading to assessment of the expected value of the intervention varying heavily with new data. Averaging over such variations can place interventions of initially seemingly different cost-effectiveness in a comparable range. I will have more to say about this in a future post.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Carl suggests that the factors mentioned in<strong> In favor of the local approach to philanthropy </strong>are not sufficiently strong to shift one's philanthropic focus from one existential risk reduction method to another on altruistic grounds when the apparent expected values of the two courses of action are more than an order of magnitude different. Certainly the largest order of magnitude of existential risk reduction that one is able to affect swamps all other orders of magnitude so that one should try to get the order of magnitude right if possible.</p>\n<p>So the question at stake is really whether the effect of \"averaging over such variations\" mentioned in the previous paragraph has a sufficiently strong dampening effect to place distinct existential risk efforts within an order of magnitude of cost-effectiveness of one another.</p>\n<p>Here a relevant point is that many of the factors influencing the cost-effectiveness of existential risk reduction efforts are shared across risks. Some examples of such factors are the rate of response of technology to influx of money and talent, international governmental relationships, the likely response of politicians to existential risks due to new technology and the quality of ability to gather information. The correlation between the uncertainties across risks cuts down on the uncertainty involved when one compares cost-effectiveness estimate to another (the uncertainty involved in assessing the relative magnitudes of cost-effectiveness estimates is lower than the uncertainty involved in assessing the absolute magnitudes of cost-effectiveness estimates.) This pushes in the direction of one being able to accurately assess relative orders of magnitude and correspondingly discern which efforts are cost-effective with enough confidence so that the dampening effect mentioned above is small.</p>\n<p>I have yet to digest these points but if they're sufficiently strong, they would have the effect of shifting the conclusion of my post to \"despite the advantages of the local approach to philanthropy over the global approach to philanthropy, in the domain of existential risk reduction the global approach to philanthropy wins out.\"</p>\n<p>Beyond that, the very strong desirability of correctly pinning down the orders of magnitude of cost-effectiveness estimates correctly points toward the high value of information.

Syndrome</a> is a rare genetic condition [...].</p>\n<p>\"Little babies will come up to you, they will stare into your face, and  it will be hard to actually disengage from that stare,\" explained Helen  Tager-Flusberg whose lab at Boston University studies the social  behavior of children with Williams. \"When they're four or five...whether  they know you or not, <strong>within about five minutes you're their new best  friend</strong>.\"</p>\n<p>One fascinating study by researchers in Europe found that children with  Williams show <strong>no racial bias whatsoever</strong>. While children, even babies,  prefer people of their own race, the neural pathway that imprints for race bias is somehow lacking in children with Williams.</p>\n<p>Williams Syndrome is <strong>caused by the deletion of roughly 25 genes on  chromosome 7</strong>. The deletion can occur randomly during the production of a  sperm or egg cell. Though there are 20,000 to 25,000 genes in the human  genome, even the loss of just 25 genes can have profound effects on a  person's physical, behavioral and cognitive make-up.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>In one experiment to test empathy, the adult experimenter bangs her knee  on a table and expresses a great deal of pain. In many runs the lab  recorded, the typically-developing child just watched and expressed no  empathy or concern. But <strong>children with Williams often went right over to  the experimenter to rub her knee and ask, \"What's wrong?\" </strong></p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p><strong>What do most children with Williams Syndrome do when presented with the creepy spider? They pet it</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a

This behavior. I thought it was strange and unique. It's incredibly common. This gave me great hope. If it is common, it means it isn't due to noise: there's a pattern there, there's something to unravel. The misjudgements of power, of what it's right to do, of when to fear and when to be bold, when to speak and when to be silent... What *is* the right thing to do when you're with a coworker on an elevator? What do you say when someone remembers you, but you don't remember them, and they have noticed that? What do you do when you're hit by a paper ball in class? What do you do when the only people you seem to be able to make friends with are older, younger, or of the opposite gender, and you're utterly intimidated by people of your same age and gender, the friendship of whom you know would profit you most? Why do you automatically recalculate trajectories to avoid acquaintances in the hall, at the super, on the bus? Why is it that when a person of the opposite gender so much as pays attention to you, you think you have a crush on them?</p>\n<p>There are clues to some of these questions in the books and works I linked back there. But, more often than not, we expect those problems to solve themselves, with one magical word, \"<a href=\"/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/\">confidence</a>\".</p>\n<p>I am confused at that notion. I find it unsatisfactory. I want to understand social awkwardness. The rules thereof. And how to vanquish it. And I want the keys in a way that can be taught. So that, when I have kids, they don't have to go through the same stupid struggles and can actually feel good about themselves and focus on getting stuff done.</p>\n<p>So, I hereby summon the powers of the Lesswrong community: let us pick apart this problem as we know so well, and let us unbury the roots of this evil that is social awkwardness, so that we nerds and geeks may defeat it at last, and live free of its funk.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018":

Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this.&nbsp; But there's a big difference between this being within a year of something like human level AI, and within a million years. As for the former meaning...I don't know.&nbsp; Maybe 5%, maybe 50%. I don't think anybody has a good estimate of this.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">If by suffering you mean prolonged suffering, then I think this is quite unlikely.&nbsp; If a super intelligent machine (or any kind of super intelligent agent) decided to get rid of us, I think it would do so pretty efficiently. I don't think we will deliberately design super intelligent machines to maximise human suffering.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q3:</strong> <em>What probability do you assign to the possibility of a human level AGI to self-modify its way up to massive superhuman intelligence within a matter of hours/days/&lt; 5 years?</em></p>\n<p><em>Explanatory remark to Q3:</em></p>\n<p><em>P(superhuman intelligence within hours | human-level AI running at human-level speed equipped with a 100 Gigabit Internet connection) = ?<br />P(superhuman intelligence within days | human-level AI running at human-level speed equipped with a 100 Gigabit Internet connection) = ?<br />P(superhuman intelligence within &lt; 5 years | human-level AI running at human-level speed equipped with a 100 Gigabit Internet connection) = ?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg:</strong> \"human level\" is a rather vague term. No doubt a machine will be super human at some things, and sub human at others.&nbsp; What kinds of things it's good at makes a big difference.<br /><br />In any case, I suspect that once we have a human level AGI, it's more likely that it will be the team of humans who understand how it works that will scale it up to something significantly super human, rather than the machine itself. Then the machine would be likely to self improve.<br /><br />How fast would that then proceed? Could be very fast, could be impossible -- there could be non-linear complexity constrains meaning that even theoretically optimal algorithms experience strongly diminishing intelligence returns for additional compute power. We just don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>Q4:</strong> <em>Is it important to figure out how to make AI provably friendly to us and our values (non-dangerous), before attempting to solve artificial general intelligence?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg:</strong> I think we have a bit of a chicken and egg issue here. At the moment we don't agree on what intelligence is or how to measure it, and we certainly don't agree on how a human level AI is going to work. So, how do we make something safe when we don't properly understand what that something is or how it will work? Some theoretical issues can be usefully considered and addressed. But without a concrete and grounded understanding of AGI, I think that an abstract analysis of the issues is going to be very shaky.</p>\n<p><strong>Q5: </strong><em>How much money is currently required to mitigate possible risks from AI (to be instrumental in maximizing your personal long-term goals, e.g. surviving this century), less/no more/little more/much more/vastly more?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg:</strong> Much more. Though, similar to many charity projects, simply throwing more money at the problem is unlikely to help all that much, and it may even make things worse. I think the biggest issue isn't really financial, but cultural. I think this is going to change as AI progresses and people start to take the idea of human level AGI within their lifetimes more seriously.&nbsp; Until that happens I think that the serious study of AGI risks will remain fringe.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6: </strong><em>Do possible risks from AI outweigh other possible existential risks, e.g. risks associated with the possibility of advanced nanotechnology?</em></p>\n<p><em>Explanatory remark to Q6:</em></p>\n<p><em>What existential risk (human extinction type event) is currently most likely to have the greatest negative impact on your personal long-term goals, under the condition that nothing is done to mitigate the risk?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg: </strong>It's my number 1 risk for this century, with an engineered biological pathogen coming a close second (though I know little about the latter).</p>\n<p><strong>Q7:&nbsp; </strong><em>What is the current level of awareness of possible risks from AI, relative to the ideal level?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg: </strong>Too low...but it could well be a double edged sword: by the time the mainstream research community starts to worry about this issue, we might be risking some kind of arms race if large companies and/or governments start to secretly panic. That would likely be bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Q8:&nbsp; </strong><em>Can you think of any milestone such that if it were ever reached you would expect human-level machine intelligence to be developed within five years thereafter?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg: </strong>That's a difficult question! When a machine can learn to play a really wide range of games from perceptual stream input and output, and transfer understanding across games, I think we'll be getting close.</p>",

Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this.&nbsp; But there's a big difference between this being within a year of something like human level AI, and within a million years. As for the former meaning...I don't know.&nbsp; Maybe 5%, maybe 50%. I don't think anybody has a good estimate of this.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">If by suffering you mean prolonged suffering, then I think this is quite unlikely.&nbsp; If a super intelligent machine (or any kind of super intelligent agent) decided to get rid of us, I think it would do so pretty efficiently. I don't think we will deliberately design super intelligent machines to maximise human suffering.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q3:</strong> <em>What probability do you assign to the possibility of a human level AGI to self-modify its way up to massive superhuman intelligence within a matter of hours/days/&lt; 5 years?</em></p>\n<p><em>Explanatory remark to Q3:</em></p>\n<p><em>P(superhuman intelligence within hours | human-level AI running at human-level speed equipped with a 100 Gigabit Internet connection) = ?<br>P(superhuman intelligence within days | human-level AI running at human-level speed equipped with a 100 Gigabit Internet connection) = ?<br>P(superhuman intelligence within &lt; 5 years | human-level AI running at human-level speed equipped with a 100 Gigabit Internet connection) = ?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg:</strong> \"human level\" is a rather vague term. No doubt a machine will be super human at some things, and sub human at others.&nbsp; What kinds of things it's good at makes a big difference.<br><br>In any case, I suspect that once we have a human level AGI, it's more likely that it will be the team of humans who understand how it works that will scale it up to something significantly super human, rather than the machine itself. Then the machine would be likely to self improve.<br><br>How fast would that then proceed? Could be very fast, could be impossible -- there could be non-linear complexity constrains meaning that even theoretically optimal algorithms experience strongly diminishing intelligence returns for additional compute power. We just don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>Q4:</strong> <em>Is it important to figure out how to make AI provably friendly to us and our values (non-dangerous), before attempting to solve artificial general intelligence?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg:</strong> I think we have a bit of a chicken and egg issue here. At the moment we don't agree on what intelligence is or how to measure it, and we certainly don't agree on how a human level AI is going to work. So, how do we make something safe when we don't properly understand what that something is or how it will work? Some theoretical issues can be usefully considered and addressed. But without a concrete and grounded understanding of AGI, I think that an abstract analysis of the issues is going to be very shaky.</p>\n<p><strong>Q5: </strong><em>How much money is currently required to mitigate possible risks from AI (to be instrumental in maximizing your personal long-term goals, e.g. surviving this century), less/no more/little more/much more/vastly more?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg:</strong> Much more. Though, similar to many charity projects, simply throwing more money at the problem is unlikely to help all that much, and it may even make things worse. I think the biggest issue isn't really financial, but cultural. I think this is going to change as AI progresses and people start to take the idea of human level AGI within their lifetimes more seriously.&nbsp; Until that happens I think that the serious study of AGI risks will remain fringe.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6: </strong><em>Do possible risks from AI outweigh other possible existential risks, e.g. risks associated with the possibility of advanced nanotechnology?</em></p>\n<p><em>Explanatory remark to Q6:</em></p>\n<p><em>What existential risk (human extinction type event) is currently most likely to have the greatest negative impact on your personal long-term goals, under the condition that nothing is done to mitigate the risk?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg: </strong>It's my number 1 risk for this century, with an engineered biological pathogen coming a close second (though I know little about the latter).</p>\n<p><strong>Q7:&nbsp; </strong><em>What is the current level of awareness of possible risks from AI, relative to the ideal level?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg: </strong>Too low...but it could well be a double edged sword: by the time the mainstream research community starts to worry about this issue, we might be risking some kind of arms race if large companies and/or governments start to secretly panic. That would likely be bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Q8:&nbsp; </strong><em>Can you think of any milestone such that if it were ever reached you would expect human-level machine intelligence to be developed within five years thereafter?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Shane Legg: </strong>That's a difficult question! When a machine can learn to play a really wide range of games from perceptual stream input and output, and transfer understanding across games, I think we'll be getting close.</p>", "sections": [{"title": "[Click here to see a list of all interviews]", "anchor": "_Click_here_to_see_a_list_of_all_interviews_", "level": 2}, {"title": "Publications by Shane Legg:", "anchor": "Publications_by_Shane_Legg_", "level": 2}, {"title": "The Interview:", "anchor": "The_Interview_", "level": 1}, {"divider": true, "level": 0, "anchor": "postHeadingsDivider"}, {"anchor": "comments", "level": 0, "title": "23 comments"}], "headingsCount": 5}, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 23, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 8, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-06-17T09:58:43.521Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "Edinburgh LW meetup reminder, Saturday, 2pm", "slug": "edinburgh-lw-meetup-reminder-saturday-2pm", "viewCount": null, "lastCommentedAt": null, "clickCount": null, "deletedDraft": false, "status": 2, "isFuture": false, "sticky": false, "stickyPriority": 2, "userIP": null, "userAgent": null, "referrer": null, "author": null, "user": {"username": "sark", "createdAt": "2010-01-20T20:18:10.889Z", "isAdmin": false, "displayName": "sark"}, "userId": "cJYNhyCitpdzsZqeP", "domain": null, "pageUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SEqvkQKGSJKzMtBg7/edinburgh-lw-meetup-reminder-saturday-2pm", "pageUrlRelative": "/posts/SEqvkQKGSJKzMtBg7/edinburgh-lw-meetup-reminder-saturday-2pm", "linkUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SEqvkQKGSJKzMtBg7/edinburgh-lw-meetup-reminder-saturday-2pm", "postedAtFormatted": "Friday, June 17th 2011", "emailShareUrl": "mailto:?subject=Interesting%20link%3A%20Edinburgh%20LW%20meetup%20reminder%2C%20Saturday%2C%202pm&body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20find%20this%20interesting%3A%0A%0AEdinburgh%20LW%20meetup%20reminder%2C%20Saturday%2C%202pm%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FSEqvkQKGSJKzMtBg7%2Fedinburgh-lw-meetup-reminder-saturday-2pm%0A%0A(found%20via%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com)%0A%20%20", "twitterShareUrl": "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Edinburgh%20LW%20meetup%20reminder%2C%20Saturday%2C%202pm%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FSEqvkQKGSJKzMtBg7%2Fedinburgh-lw-meetup-reminder-saturday-2pm", "facebookShareUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FSEqvkQKGSJKzMtBg7%2Fedinburgh-lw-meetup-reminder-saturday-2pm", "socialPreviewImageUrl": "", "question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 41, "htmlBody": "<p>As usual, it will be at the Delhi Cafe.</p>\n<p>Concerning the Grand Meetup: This has now been moved to the last Saturday of each month.

A summary (taken from the <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong/2007_Articles/Summaries\">LW wiki</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>People want to think that the Enemy is an innately evil mutant. But, usually, the Enemy is acting as you might in their circumstances. They think that they are the hero in their story and that their motives are just. That doesn't mean that they are right. Killing them may be the best option available. But it is still a tragedy.</blockquote>\n<p>Discuss the post here (rather than in the comments to the original post).</p>\n<p><em>This post is part of the <a href=\"/r/discussion/tag/sequence_reruns/\">Rerunning the Sequences</a> series, in which we're going through Eliezer Yudkowsky's old posts in order, so that people who are interested can (re-)read and discuss them.

"question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 801, "htmlBody": "<p>Here's a simple theorem in utility theory that I haven't seen anywhere. Maybe it's standard knowledge, or maybe not.</p>\n<p>TL,DR: More information is never a bad thing.</p>\n<p>The theorem proved below says that before you make an observation, you cannot expect it to decrease your utility, but you can sometimes expect it to increase your utility. &nbsp;I'm ignoring the cost of obtaining the additional data, and any losses consequential on the time it takes. These are real considerations in any practical situation, but they are not the subject of this note.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a>First, an example to illustrate the principle. Suppose you are faced with two choices, A and B. One of them is right and one is wrong, and it's very important to make the right choice, because being right will confer some large positive utility U (you get to marry the princess), while the wrong choice will get you -U (eaten by a tiger). However, you're not sure which is the right choice. &nbsp;You estimate that there's a 51% chance that A is right, and 49% that B is right. &nbsp;So, you shut up and multiply, and choose A for an expected utility of 0.02U, right?</p>\n<p>Suppose the choice does not have to be made immediately, and that you can do something to get better information about whether A or B is the right choice. Say you can make certain observations which will tell you with 99% certainty which is right. Your prior expectation of your posterior is equal to your prior, so before you make the observation, you expect a 50/98 chance of it telling you that A is right, and 48/98 that B is right.</p>\n<p>You make the observation and then choose the course of action it tells you. &nbsp;Whether it says A or B, it's 99% likely to be right, so your expected utility from choosing according to the observation is 0.98U, an increase over not making the observation of 0.96U.</p>\n<p>Clearly, you should make the observation. Even though you cannot expect what it will tell you, you can expect to greatly benefit from whatever it tells you.</p>\n<p>Now the general case.</p>\n<p>Theorem: Every act of observation has, before you make it, a non-negative expected utility.</p>\n<p>Proof. &nbsp;Let the set of actions available to an agent be C. &nbsp;For each action c in C, the agent has a probability distribution over possible outcomes. &nbsp;Each outcome has a certain utility. &nbsp;For present purposes it is not necessary to distinguish between outcomes and their utility, so we shall consider the agent to have, for each action c, a probability distribution P_c(u) over utilities u. &nbsp;The expectation value int_u u P_c(u) of that distribution is the prior expected utility of the choice c, and the agent's rational choice, given no other information, is to choose that c which maximises int_u u P_c(u). &nbsp;The resulting utility is max_c int_u u P_c(u).</p>\n<p>(I can't be bothered to fiddle with the system for getting mathematics typeset as images. &nbsp;The underscore indicates subscripts, int_x means integral with respect to x, and max_x means the maximum value over all x. &nbsp;Take care to backslash all the underscores if quoting any of this.)</p>\n<p>Now suppose the agent makes an observation, with result o. &nbsp;This gives the agent a new probability distribution for each choice c over outcomes: P_c(u|o). It should choose the c that maximises int_u u P_c(u|o).</p>\n<p>The agent also has a prior distribution of observations P(o). &nbsp;Before making the observation, the expected distribution of utility returned by doing c after the observation is int_o P(o) P_c(u|o). &nbsp;This is equal to P_c(u), as it should be, by the principle that your prior estimate of your posterior distribution of a variable must coincide with your prior distribution.</p>\n<p>We therefore have the following expected utilities. &nbsp;If we choose the action without making the observation, the utility is</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;max_c int_u u P_c(u)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= max_c int_u u int_o P(o) P_c(u|o)</p>\n<p>If we observe, then choose, we get</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int_o P(o) max_c int_u u P_c(u|o)</p>\n<p>The second of these is always at least as large as the first. &nbsp;Proof:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;max_c int_u u int_o P(o) P_c(u|o)<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;max_c int_o P(o) int_u u P_c(u|o)<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;= max_c int_o P(o) max_c int_u u P_c(u|o)<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;int_o P(o) max_c int_u u P_c(u|o)</p>\n<p>ETA: In some cases, a non-zero amount of new information will make zero change to your expected utility. In the original example,&nbsp;suppose that your prior probabilities were 75% for A being right, and 25% for B. You make an additional and rather weak observation which, if it says \"choose A\" raises your posterior probability for A to 80%, while if it says \"choose B\", it only diminishes your posterior for A to 60%. In either case you still choose A and your expected utility (prior to actually making the observation) is unchanged.</p>\n<p>Or informally, further research is only useful if there is a possibility of it telling you enough to change your mind.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null,

People are not allowed to vote for their own submissions.</p>\n<p>The summary should address questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What spacing is best?</li>\n<li>How much does spaced repetition actually help memory?</li>\n<li>Does spaced repetition have hidden benefits or costs?</li>\n<li>Does the effectiveness vary across domains? How much?&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Is there research on the kinds of questions that work best? Especially for avoiding 'guessing the password' and memorizing the card per se rather than the material.</li>\n<li>What questions do researchers think are most important?</li>\n<li>Is there any interesting ongoing research? If so, what is it on?</li>\n<li>What, if any, questions do researchers think it is important to answer? Are there other unanswered questions that would jump out at a smart person?</li>\n<li>What does spaced repetition&nbsp;not&nbsp;do that people might expect it to?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post should summarize the state of current evidence and provide citations to back up the claims in the article. Referencing both academic and non-academic research is encouraged. Lukeprog's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_Science_of_Winning_at_Life\" target=\"_blank\">The Science of Winning At Life</a>&nbsp;sequence contains several examples of good literature review posts.</p>\n<p>If you think you would benefit from the result of this project, please add to the prize! You can contribute to the prize on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://jsalvatier.chipin.com/spaced-repetition-research-summary\" target=\"_blank\">ChipIn page</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have suggestions, questions or comments, please leave them in the comments. Prizes demotivating? Due date too soon/far? Specification too vague? Judgement procedure not credible enough?</p>\n<p>This project is tagged with the 'project' tag and listed on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Projects\" target=\"_blank\">Projects

false, "wordCount": 781, "htmlBody": "<p>I've been thinking about wireheading and the nature of my values. <a href=\"/lw/lb/not_for_the_sake_of_happiness_alone/\">Many</a> <a href=\"/lw/65w/not_for_the_sake_of_pleasure_alone/\">people</a> <a href=\"/lw/15c/would_your_real_preferences_please_stand_up\">here</a> have defended the importance of external referents or complex desires. My problem is, I can't understand these claims at all.</p>\n<p>To clarify, I mean wireheading in the strict \"collapsing into orgasmium\" sense. A successful implementation would identify all the reward circuitry and directly stimulate it, or do something equivalent. It would essentially be a vastly improved heroin. A good argument for either keeping complex values (e.g. by requiring at least a personal matrix) or external referents (e.g. by showing that a simulation can never suffice) would work for me.</p>\n<p>Also, I use \"reward\" as short-hand for any enjoyable feeling, as \"pleasure\" tends to be used for a specific one of them, among bliss, excitement and so on, and \"it's not about feeling X, but X and Y\" is still wireheading after all.</p>\n<p>I tried collecting all related arguments I could find. (Roughly sorted from weak to very weak, as I understand them, plus link to example instances. I also searched any literature/other sites I could think of, but didn't find other  (not blatantly incoherent) arguments.)</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/65w/not_for_the_sake_of_pleasure_alone/\">People do not always optimize their actions based on achieving rewards.</a> (People also are horrible at making predictions and great at rationalizing their failures afterwards.)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/1oc/you_cannot_be_mistaken_about_not_wanting_to\">It is possible to enjoy doing something while wanting to stop</a> or vice versa, do something without enjoying it while wanting to continue. (Seriously? I can't remember ever doing either. What makes you think that the action is thus valid, and you aren't just making mistaken predictions about rewards or are being exploited? Also, <a href=\"/lw/zv/post_your_utility_function/sqg\">Mind Projection Fallacy</a>.)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/1o9/welcome_to_heaven/1id8\">A wireheaded \"me\" wouldn't be \"me\" anymore.</a> (What's this \"self\" you're talking about? Why does it matter that it's preserved?)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/1o9/welcome_to_heaven/1icy\">\"I don't want it and that's that.\"</a> (Why? What's this \"wanting\" you do? How do you know what you \"want\"? (see end of post))</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/65w/not_for_the_sake_of_pleasure_alone/\">People, if given a hypothetical offer of being wireheaded, tend to refuse.</a> (The exact result <a href=\"http://www.unc.edu/~brigard/Xmach.pdf \">depends heavily on the exact question being asked</a>. There are many biases at work here and we normally know better than to trust the majority intuition, so why should we trust it here?)</li>\n<li>Far-mode predictions tend to favor complex, external actions, while near-mode predictions are simpler, more hedonistic. <a href=\"/lw/15c/would_your_real_preferences_please_stand_up\">Our true self is the far one, not the near one</a>. (Why? The opposite is equally plausible. Or the falsehood of the near/far model in general.)</li>\n<li>If we imagine a wireheaded future, <a href=\"/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/\">it feels like something is missing</a> or like we won't <em>really</em> be happy. (Intuition pump.)</li>\n<li>It is not socially acceptable to embrace wireheading. (So what? Also, depends on the phrasing and society in question.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(There have also been technical arguments against specific implementations of wireheading. I'm not concerned with those, as long as they don't show impossibility.)</p>\n<p>Overall, none of this sounds remotely plausible to me. Most of it is outright question-begging or relies on intuition pumps that don't even work for me.</p>\n<p>It confuses me that others might be convinced by arguments of this sort, so it seems likely that I have a fundamental misunderstanding or there are implicit assumptions I don't see. I fear that I have a large <a href=\"/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/\">inferential gap</a> here, so please be explicit and assume I'm a Martian. I genuinely feel like Gamma in <a href=\"/lw/1op/a_much_better_life/\">A Much Better Life</a>.</p>\n<p>To me, all this talk about \"valueing something\" sounds like someone talking about \"feeling the presence of the Holy Ghost\". I don't mean this in a derogatory way, but the pattern \"sense something funny, therefore some very specific and otherwise unsupported claim\" matches. How do you know it's not just, you know, indigestion?</p>\n<p>What is this \"valuing\"? How do you know that something is a \"value\", terminal or not? How do you know what it's about? How would you know if you were mistaken? What about unconscious hypocrisy or confabulation? Where do these \"values\" come from (i.e. what process creates them)? Overall, it sounds to me like people are confusing their <em>feelings</em> about (predicted) states of the world with caring about states directly.</p>\n<p>To me, it seems like it's all about anticipating and achieving rewards (and avoiding punishments, but for the sake of the wireheading argument, it's equivalent). I make predicitions about what actions will trigger rewards (or instrumentally help me pursue those actions) and then engage in them. If my prediction was wrong, I drop the activity and try something else. If I \"wanted\" something, but getting it didn't trigger a rewarding feeling, I wouldn't take that as evidence that I \"value\" the activity for its own sake. I'd assume I suck at predicting or was ripped off.</p>\n<p>Can someone give a reason why wireheading would be bad?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

A summary (taken from the <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong/2007_Articles/Summaries\">LW wiki</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>School encourages two bad habits of thought: (1) equating \"knowledge\" with the ability to parrot back answers that the teacher expects; and (2) assuming that authorities are perfectly reliable. The first happens because students don't have enough time to digest what they learn. The second happens especially in fields like physics because students are so often just handed the right answer.</blockquote>\n<p>Discuss the post here (rather than in the comments to the original post).</p>\n<p><em>This post is part of the <a href=\"/r/discussion/tag/sequence_reruns/\">Rerunning the Sequences</a> series, in which we're going through Eliezer Yudkowsky's old posts in order, so that people who are interested can (re-)read and discuss them.

href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/03/the_case_agains_6.html \">news is generally useless</a>:</p>\n<p>However, there are some analytical sources of news that are exceptions.</p>\n<p>Personally, what I find most stimulating is&nbsp;http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/home.aspx .&nbsp;http://www.cato-unbound.org/ is also quite stimulating, although it isn't contemporary news. Then on the more non-news-y side, IEEE Spectrum and Communications of the ACM can occasionally be great. And while Scientific American has dumbed down in recent years, the featured articles in Science News (http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feed/type/article) are *amazingly* insightful. Two examples are below:</p>\n<p>http://blog.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/330593/title/Inside_Job http://www.comoogl.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/74456/title/Healthy_Aging_in_a_Pill</p>\n<p>You usually don't even get analyses like these in Science or Nature.</p>\n<p>And&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.newgeography.com/\">http://www.newgeography.com/</a>&nbsp;is surprisingly insightful.</p>\n<p>What do people here think of The Atlantic? It's better than other news sources, and I was impressed with it when I was in 8th grade. And some columnists, particularly Reihan Salam, are great (Reihan isn't in the position of supporting *any* politician or party, so that puts him in a position where I don't suspect him of twisting facts [even a little bit] to support his position - something that I do often suspect for people like Ezra Klein and other left-wing pundits). But even The Atlantic does seem to be too much in line with mainstream opinion.</p>\n<p>Other than that, I get most of my analysis from Gene Expression and Information Processing. I'm not too much of an economist yet, so I don't really read the economics blogs. FuturePundit/ParaPundit is right on many things, but its blogposts don't contain too much depth in them.&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "cX3WPouR2xk4kcdbs", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 7, "baseScore": 9, "extendedScore": null, "score": 7.29788589794464e-07, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "8130", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 6, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": null, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 10, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-06-19T12:44:16.628Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "Much-Better-Life Simulator\u2122 -

Let me ask you how much utility you assign to one hour of <em>ultimate well-being</em>&trade;, where 'ultimate' means the best possible satisfaction of all desirable bodily sensations a human body and brain is capable of experiencing?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Customer:</strong> Hmm, that's a tough question. I am not sure how to assign a certain amount of utility to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sales girl:</strong> You say that you value reality more than what you call 'fiction'. But you nonetheless value fiction, right?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Customer:</strong> Yes of course, I love fiction. I read science fiction books and watch movies like most humans do.</p>\n<p><strong>Sales girl:</strong> Then how much more would you value one hour of <em>ultimate well-being</em>&trade; by other means compared to one hour of <em>ultimate well-being</em>&trade; that is the result of our <em>Much-Better-Life Simulator</em>&trade;?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Customer:</strong> If you ask me like that, I would exchange ten hours in your simulator with one hour of real satisfaction, something that is the result of an actual achievement rather than your fake.</p>\n<p><strong>Sales girl:</strong> Thank you. Would you agree if I said that for you one hour outside, that is 10 times less satisfying, roughly equals one hour in our simulator?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Customer:</strong> Yes, for sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Sales girl:</strong> Then you should buy our product. Not only is it very unlikely for you to experience even a tenth of <em>ultimate well-being</em>&trade; that we offer more than a few times per year, but our simulator delivers and allows your brain to experience 20 times more perceptual data than you would be able to experience outside of our simulator. All this at a constant rate while experiencing <em>ultimate well-being</em>&trade;. And we offer free upgrades that are expected to deliver exponential speed-ups and qualitative improvements for the next few decades.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Customer:</strong> Thanks, but no thanks. I rather enjoy the real thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Sales girl:</strong> But I showed you that our product easily outweighs the additional amount of utility you expected to experience outside of our simulator.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Customer:</strong> You just tricked me into this utility thing, I don't want to buy your product. Please leave me alone now.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018":

expected utility of  various outcomes of alternative actions. It is precommited to choosing  the outcome with the largest expected utility. Consequently it is choosing the action that yields the largest expected utility.</p>\n<p>But one unit of  utility is not discriminable from another unit of utility. All a utility  maximizer can do is to maximize expected utility. What if it turns out that  one of its complex values can be much more effectively realized and optimized than its other values, i.e. has the best cost-value ratio? That value might turn out to outweigh all other values.</p>\n<p>How can this be countered? One possibility seems to be changing one's utility function and reassign utility in such a way as  to outweigh that effect. But this will lead to inconsistency. Another way is  to discount the value that threatens to outweigh all others. Which will  again lead to inconsistency.</p>\n<p>This seems to suggest that subscribing to expected utility maximization means that 1.) you swap  your complex values for a certain terminal goal with the highest  expected utility 2.) your  decision-making is eventually dominated by a narrow set of values that are the easiest to realize and promise the most utility.</p>\n<p>Can someone please explain how I am wrong or point me to some digestible explanation? Likewise I would be pleased if someone could tell me what mathematical background is required to understand expected utility maximization formally.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true,

A summary (taken from the <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong/2007_Articles/Summaries\">LW wiki</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>Not every belief that we have is directly about sensory experience, but beliefs should pay rent in anticipations of experience. For example, if I believe that \"Gravity is 9.8 m/s^2\" then I should be able to predict where I'll see the second hand on my watch at the time I hear the crash of a bowling ball dropped off a building. On the other hand, if your postmodern English professor says that the famous writer Wulky is a \"post-utopian\", this may not actually mean anything. The moral is to ask \"What experiences do I anticipate?\" not \"What statements do I believe?\"</blockquote>\n<p>Discuss the post here (rather than in the comments to the original post).</p>\n<p><em>This post is part of the <a href=\"/r/discussion/tag/sequence_reruns/\">Rerunning the Sequences</a> series, in which we're going through Eliezer Yudkowsky's old posts in order, so that people who are interested can (re-)read and discuss them.

If I thought I that I was such a great &nbsp;speaker that I could go in front of a group, stare at the ground, and then stutter into some note cards while mumbling offensive things to the audience and have them like it, I'd be wrong. If I even just thought I was going to do a good presentation and then didn't do anything, I'd be wrong.</p>\n<p>A belief alone isn't actually enough to do anything. There needs to be a causal reason for your holding a belief to influence the world. Your beliefs influence what you do, and what you do influences the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Some religious people argue that their belief in God allows them to be a good person. As we know, you can be a good person without believing in God. Controlling for what you do, and with tight enough definitions on \"what you do\", your beliefs are effectively screened off from the rest of the world unless you're being brain scanned or something.</p>\n<p>A causal diagram can be drawn as such:</p>\n<p>Alice believes in X &rarr;&nbsp;Alice's anticipations based on X make her choose to do Y &rarr;&nbsp;Y has effect Z</p>\n<p>Consider&nbsp;Alice believes that she is funny &rarr;&nbsp;Alice's expectations of delivering a funny joke leads her to deliver a joke well &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Alice's good joke delivery makes Bob think that she's funny</p>\n<p>In this diagram, if Alice just does Y her belief in X is screened off from effect Z.</p>\n<p><strong>Taking apart Foma</strong></p>\n<p>People's brains don't normally think particularly rigorously. When language combines two different things into one or frames something as an intrinsic property of an object (\"Alice thinks Alice is funny\" and \"Bob thinks Alice is funny\" often becomes \"Alice is funny\"), it can seem like foma occur. On top of that, we often act to fulfill or preserve our self image (remember&nbsp;<a href=\"/lw/9o/stuck_in_the_middle_with_bruce/\">Bruce</a>?).</p>\n<p>It's easy for Alice to think that her belief that she's funny is causing her to be funny. If she were more precise, she could get away with:</p>\n<p>Alice believes that actions Y have effect Z&nbsp;&rarr; Alice does Y&nbsp;&rarr; Y has effect Z</p>\n<p>With specifics,</p>\n<p>Alice knows that people find a joke funny when its set up right and has good timing&nbsp;&rarr; Alice sets up the joke correctly and has good timing&nbsp;&rarr; Bob finds the joke funny</p>\n<p>Every step of&nbsp;<em style=\"font-style: italic;\">that</em>&nbsp;chain is entirely true.</p>\n<p><strong>When Foma are Practical</strong></p>\n<p>Part of the reason that I took so long to take apart foma was probably that, in the areas that I experienced foma, I wasn't consciously processing my actions. The awkward things that I did while I thought I was being awkward were never part of an intentional strategy, they just sort of happened. Since changing my beliefs seemed to do something, it felt like they had a direct causal effect on the world.</p>\n<p>With the unpacking of foma in mind however, it's easier to discover which behaviors are actually influencing the world. When you feel like you're experiencing foma, you have an opportunity to learn something about what you do or don't do successfully.</p>\n<p>For instance, when I feel awkward I'll start speaking when I feel that someone made a pause in conversation, but then stop and let someone else to speak, then continually almost interrupt them.</p>\n<p>When I feel like I'm funny, I'll extend pauses after particularly emphasized parts of a joke, and slightly vary my volume and speed of talking based on relevance to the punchline.</p>\n<p>In some instances, it probably is easier to believe in foma than to act on the relevant beliefs. As of right now, my unconscious mind knows much more about how to be confident than my conscious mind does, and on top of that it has much better processing power with which to act on its knowledge, and keep track of other people's responses. It runs more automatically, and continues to deliver while I'm consciously distracted. When I need to act confident, I find it to be much more time efficient and effective to just \"psych myself up\" than to review everything I know about body language and whatnot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {"Ng8Gice9KNkncxqcj": 1}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "ckYGaqaq5kXz4oMvY", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 30, "baseScore": 36, "extendedScore": null, "score": 7.4e-05, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "7949", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 36, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": {"html": "<p>tl;dr: Sometimes it seems like in order to accomplish something, you need to hold a particular belief.

When I need to act confident, I find it to be much more time efficient and effective to just \"psych myself up\" than to review everything I know about body language and whatnot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "sections": [{"title": "Foma: Beliefs that Cause Themselves to be True", "anchor": "Foma__Beliefs_that_Cause_Themselves_to_be_True", "level": 1}, {"title": "Anticipations Influence Action", "anchor": "Anticipations_Influence_Action", "level": 1}, {"title": "Taking apart Foma", "anchor": "Taking_apart_Foma", "level": 1}, {"title": "When Foma are Practical", "anchor": "When_Foma_are_Practical", "level": 1}, {"divider": true, "level": 0, "anchor": "postHeadingsDivider"}, {"anchor": "comments", "level": 0, "title": "39 comments"}], "headingsCount": 6}, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 39, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {"Posts": ["FZaDFYbnRoHmde7F6"]}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-06-20T10:08:22.305Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "The proper use of regret?", "slug": "the-proper-use-of-regret", "viewCount": null, "lastCommentedAt": "2017-06-17T03:59:26.589Z", "clickCount": null, "deletedDraft": false, "status": 2, "isFuture": false, "sticky": false, "stickyPriority": 2, "userIP": null, "userAgent": null, "referrer": null, "author": null, "user": {"username": "sark", "createdAt": "2010-01-20T20:18:10.889Z", "isAdmin": false, "displayName": "sark"}, "userId": "cJYNhyCitpdzsZqeP", "domain": null, "pageUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6BXXwLRDYQGZSy6wo/the-proper-use-of-regret", "pageUrlRelative": "/posts/6BXXwLRDYQGZSy6wo/the-proper-use-of-regret", "linkUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6BXXwLRDYQGZSy6wo/the-proper-use-of-regret", "postedAtFormatted": "Monday, June 20th 2011", "emailShareUrl": "mailto:?subject=Interesting%20link%3A%20The%20proper%20use%20of%20regret%3F&body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20find%20this%20interesting%3A%0A%0AThe%20proper%20use%20of%20regret%3F%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2F6BXXwLRDYQGZSy6wo%2Fthe-proper-use-of-regret%0A%0A(found%20via%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com)%0A%20%20", "twitterShareUrl": "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20proper%20use%20of%20regret%3F%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2F6BXXwLRDYQGZSy6wo%2Fthe-proper-use-of-regret", "facebookShareUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2F6BXXwLRDYQGZSy6wo%2Fthe-proper-use-of-regret", "socialPreviewImageUrl": "", "question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 313, "htmlBody": "<p>Bryan Caplan in <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/06/parenthood_as_t.html\">Parenthood as the Trump of All Past Regret</a> explains: whatever tiny alterations he makes to his life before he had his children, would result in him not having the precise children he has today whom he so dearly loves, and therefore he does not regret a thing.</p>\n<p>This is seems to me like an entirely wrong use of regret. I think regret is useful when it suggests how you could have done otherwise, when having different such behavioral policy consistently leads to better results in structurally similar situations.</p>\n<p>It's not exactly like the mistake of thinking that chaos theory should suggest you pay attention to every little thing in life. There the mistake was to think you could reliably and precisely enough predict how the little things being different leads to outcomes being different. Bryan is thinking about a very specific outcome in his life which he already knows has come to pass. He is counterfactually considering how it would not have been if everything in his past were not exactly as they were.</p>\n<p>But given determinism, everything is already decided. This does not rule out free will, but it does suggest a proper use for counterfactuals. According to Vladimir Nesov: The meaning of a thing is how you should be influenced by it (the most&nbsp;succinct&nbsp;expression of LW philosophy imho). According to Gary Drescher: Why should you consider alternatives when making a decision, given that your ultimate actions are already determined? Because counterfactually-speaking if you did not consider such alternatives, you wouldn't have decided the way you did. So the use of counterfactuals, and in particular regret, is for us deciding how to behave. I don't see how Caplan's regret makes use of this.</p>\n<p>And of course, there are other aesthetic uses to counterfactuals. Fiction, to take an obvious example.

theories of value imply that even relatively small reductions in net existential risk have enormous expected value.&nbsp; Despite their importance, issues surrounding human-extinction risks and related hazards remain poorly understood.&nbsp; In this paper, I clarify the concept of existential risk and develop an improved classification scheme.&nbsp; I discuss the relation between existential risks and basic issues in axiology, and show how existential risk reduction (via the maxipok rule) can serve as a strongly action-guiding principle for utilitarian concerns.&nbsp; I also show how the notion of existential risk suggests a new way of thinking about the ideal of sustainability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Link: </strong><strong><a

gurus.</p>\n<p>Recently I found an opportunity to use the Bayes' theorem in real life to help myself update in the following situation (presented in gender-neutral way):<br /> <br />Let's say you are wondering if a person is interested in you romantically. And they bought you a drink.<br /> A = they are interested in you.<br />B = they bought you a drink.<br />P(A) = 0.3 (Just an assumption.)<br />P(B) = 0.05 (Approximately 1 out of 20 people, who might be at all interested in you, will buy you a drink for some unknown reason.)<br />P(B|A) = 0.2 (Approximately 1 out of 5 people, who <em>are</em> interested in you, will buy you a drink for some unknown reason. Though it's more likely they will buy you a drink <em>because </em>they are interested in you.)<br /> <br /> These numbers seem valid to me, and I can't see anything that's obviously wrong. But when I actually use Bayes' theorem:<br /> P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = <strong>1.2</strong><br /> Uh-oh! Where did I go wrong? See if you can spot the error before continuing.</p>\n<p>Turns out:<br /> P(B|A) = P(A&cap;B) / P(A) &le; P(B) / P(A) = 0.1667<br /> BUT<br /> P(B|A) = 0.2 &gt; 0.1667<br /> <br /> I've made a mistake in estimating my probabilities, even though it felt intuitive. Yet, I don't immediately see where I went wrong when I look at the original estimates! What's the best way to prevent this kind of mistake?<br /> I feel pretty confident in my estimates of P(A) and P(B|A). However, estimating P(B) is rather difficult because I need to consider <em>many scenarios</em>.</p>\n<p>I can compute P(B) more precisely by considering all the scenarios that would lead to B happening (see <a title=\"Bayesian Probability\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability\" target=\"_blank\">wiki article</a>):</p>\n<p>P(B) = &sum;<sub>i</sub> P(B|H<sub>i</sub>) * P(H<sub>i</sub>)</p>\n<p>Let's do a quick breakdown of everyone who would want to buy you a drink (out of the pool of people who might be at all interested in you):<br />P(<em>misc</em>. reasons) = 0.05; P(B|<em>misc</em>) = 0.01<br />P(they are just <em>friendly</em> and buy drinks for everyone they meet) = 0.05; P(B|<em>friendly</em>) = 0.8<br />P(they want to be <em>friends</em>) = 0.3; P(B|<em>friends</em>) = 0.1<br />P(they are <em>interested</em> in you) = 0.6; P(B|<em>interested</em>) = P(B|A) = 0.2<br /> So, P(B) = 0.1905<br /> And, P(A|B) = <strong>0.315</strong> (very different from 1.2!)</p>\n<p>Once I started thinking about all possible scenarios, I found one I haven't considered explicitly -- some people buy drinks for everyone they meet -- which adds a good amount of probability (0.04) to B happening. (Those types of people are rare, but they WILL buy you a drink.) There are also other interesting assumptions that are made explicit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Out of all the people under consideration in this problem, there are twice as many people who would be romantically interested in you vs. people who would want to be your friend.</li>\n<li>People who are interested in you will buy you a drink twice as often as people who want to be your friend.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The moral of the story is to consider all possible scenarios (models/hypothesis) which can lead to the event you have observed. It's possible you are missing some scenarios, which under consideration will significantly alter your probability estimates.</p>\n<p>Do you know any other ways to make the use of Bayes' theorem more accurate?

Reported details are complicated and possibly unreliable, but a fair amount is known. Trading is suspended while the exchange's source code is checked for vulnerabilities. All MtGox accounts are being put through a verification process and mandatory password reset. According to <a href=\"https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20208066-huge-bitcoin-sell-off-due-to-a-compromised-account-rollback\">MtGox's support page</a>, a compromised account with 500k coins did a massive sell-off, clearing the order book and driving the price down to 0.01; MtGox has announced that trades around this time will be rolled back. A database of hashed usernames, email addresses, and passwords was leaked on or before June 17 (several hashes from the leaked database were posted on a forum). There is also a <a href=\"http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=18709.0\">report</a> that a cross-site request forgery vulnerability existed, and was being used to steal from users, probably for weeks. There are also highly plausible reports of a SQL injection vulnerability. MtGox has claimed that only $1000 worth of coins were lost, but this is unclear; the large sell-off may have been an attempt to work around the withdrawal rate limit, by making the rate-limiter use an incorrect exchange rate. <a href=\"http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=20000.0\">Analysis of the blockchain</a> seems to suggest that MtGox does still control its coins, or at least a large number of coins.</p>\n<p>In the best-case scenario, MtGox reopens for business in a couple days, some traders who would have profited from the sell-off will be angry, and the Bitcoin economy, such as it is, continues as before. In the worst case, MtGox is insolvent, either because they lost more coins as a result of this attack or an earlier attack than they've acknowledged, or because the coming run on the exchange exposes an undisclosed fractional reserve policy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, TradeHill, the second-largest exchange, is trading at 13.2 USD/BTC with greatly increased volume, compared to 17.5 before this all started. The EFF has stopped accepting BitCoins, in response to these events, and donated their Bitcoin holdings to the Bitcoin faucet. Botnet herders have started hunting for Bitcoin wallets, and allinvain (real name unknown) <a href=\"http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=16457.0\">reported</a> losing 25kBTC from an unencrypted wallet that way.</p>\n<p>And I, with a significant amount of both US dollars and Bitcoins frozen on MtGox, am having a very hard time focusing on cell phone app development.</p>", "submitToFrontpage":

Belief</a> was originally published on July 29, 2007.  A summary (taken from the <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong/2007_Articles/Summaries\">LW wiki</a>):</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>Suppose someone claims to have a dragon in their garage, but as soon as you go to look, they say, \"It's an <em>invisible </em>dragon!\" The remarkable thing is that they know <em>in advance</em> exactly which experimental results they shall have to excuse, indicating that some part of their mind knows what's really going on. And yet they may honestly <em>believe </em>they believe there's a dragon in the garage. They may perhaps believe it is <em>virtuous </em>to believe there is a dragon in the garage, and believe themselves virtuous. Even though they <em>anticipate as if</em> there is no dragon.</blockquote>\n<p><br />Discuss the post here (rather than in the comments to the original post).<br /><br /><em>This post is part of the Rerunning the Sequences series, where we'll be going through Eliezer Yudkowsky's old posts in order so that people who are interested can (re-)read and discuss them.

on, and having changed my mind a few times on at least a few ideas that I'd been fairly sure about... I feel that I finally have enough of a grasp of the basics of LessWrong-style rationality to start trying to introduce it to other people. And while the Sequences form a good set of basics, getting someone interested enough in rationality to start reading them is a step of its own... and, as best as I can tell, one that needs to be custom-tailored to a particular audience.</p>\n<p>For my first attempt, I've focused on two online subcultures which I'm at least somewhat familiar with: furries and a certain subset of libertarians. For example, a large number of furry fans are fairly easy to please - give them a short comic to read involving a cute anthropomorphic animal, throw in a bit of sex appeal and maybe a message that's compatible with tolerance of all people, and that comic will be happily read by a lot of them. Trying to avoid \"politics is the mind-killer\" derailment, the community of libertarians I'm aiming for tend to have their own quirks about what attracts their attention.</p>\n<p>The result I came up with was the creation of <a href=\"http://www.datapacrat.com/sketches/rationality.html\">Rationality Matters</a>, a couple of comics pages that introduce some LW-type thoughts in an audience-compatible fashion without beating the readers' heads with them. I've already received some positive feedback from members of both target groups, indicating that I've accomplished my goal with at least a few individuals... so now I'm posting the link here, for whatever feedback I can get that could improve the existing pages (mainly for the text, since re-doing the art at this stage is impractical), and to make any future pages (should I decide to create them) better than I would have made them without such help.</p>\n<p>(And yes, I try to follow <a href=\"http://www.sl4.org/crocker.html\">Crocker's Rules</a>.)</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true,

Rationalist Sequences) Don't Implement Themselves</a>, <a href=\"/lw/5o1/designing_rationalist_projects/\">Designing rationalist projects</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm beginning a new subseries of posts, trying to answer the following question: what should be the roles in a rationalist community?<span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In this post and the next one, I will outline the roles in Latter-day Saint communities. In the following posts, I will draw more conclusions as to which roles would be ideal for rationalist communities.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I should note that these sets of responsibilities are designed to function in congregations where 100 to 150 people come to church every week. They are slimmed down when the congregations are smaller. I&rsquo;m going to outline all the roles, and as I go, I&rsquo;ll note which ones are the most important.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Main Roles</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are four main groups of &ldquo;callings,&rdquo; responsibilities in the church. I will discuss the first two groups in this post.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">First, there are the teachers, who speak, teach and lead discussions in Sunday church meetings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Second, there are auxiliaries, responsible for ensuring the well-being of the various segments of the congregation. In each congregation, there is a women&rsquo;s organization, a men&rsquo;s organization, as well as young women&rsquo;s, young men&rsquo;s, and children&rsquo;s organizations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In smaller groups, the leaders and more-committed members often wear multiple hats.<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em>Teachers</em></strong><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><strong>.</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Teachers [are] foot soldiers in the ongoing war against ignorance and complacency. Sunday worship is only as good and effective as the teaching.\" - Orson Scott Card. (<a href=\"http://www.mormontimes.com/article/19589/Are-there-silos-in-our-wards\">Link</a>, read the whole piece if you like this one.)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some members of the congregation are selected as regular teachers, who teach &ldquo;Sunday school&rdquo; classes to everyone, for two hours of class every Sunday.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition, every week, three speakers from the congregation are assigned to give talks in the one-hour everyone-together &ldquo;sacrament meeting&rdquo;. These rotate every week; people rarely give talks more than once every six months.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Teacher selection</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Qualifications? Interestingness and the ability to promote personal applications.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main enemy in church is simply boring-ness. Making a learning experience interesting is a nontrivial problem: visit your local school for evidence of that. This is even more where everybody is expected to teach, at some point.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Speakers in the everyone-together &ldquo;sacrament meeting&rdquo; can drone on about favorite stories. Teachers can um and er their way through the lesson and ask bad questions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While selecting teachers, leaders must balance two conflicting objectives: interesting classes and skill development.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the one hand, if you pick the relatively confident, outgoing, intelligent people to teach, you&rsquo;re more likely to have interesting classes. On the other hand, if these people teach all the time, the others will never get a chance to learn to teach.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Why is learning to teach so important for everyone? Well, everyone has to teach their children.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"#_ftn1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[1]</span></span></a> Plus there are recruiting and career benefits.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The usual compromise is a mix of the two types. Some teachers are picked primarily so the classes will learn, and some are picked primarily so the teachers will learn.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" href=\"#_ftn2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[2]</span></span></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is supported by a shared norm/belief that the responsibility to learn lies with each individual; and you shouldn&rsquo;t blame a bad teacher. In a class focused on basic principles of living life, through sufficient humility and introspection, you can learn in any class, even given a less-articulate or educated teacher.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" href=\"#_ftn3\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[3]</span></span></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The norm is most clearly articulated by <a href=\"http://members.fortunecity.com/phantom1/books2/c._s._lewis_-_the_screwtape_letters.htm\">C.S. Lewis:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">an attitude which may, indeed, be critical in the sense of rejecting what is false or unhelpful, but which is wholly uncritical in the sense that it does not appraise&mdash;does not waste time in thinking about what it rejects, but lays itself open in uncommenting, humble receptivity to any nourishment that is going. This attitude, especially during sermons, creates the condition in which platitudes can become really audible to a human soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Manuals. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The church, having been around for awhile, condensed the doctrine into a set of manuals. <a href=\"http://lds.org/manual/gospel-principles?lang=eng\">Here</a> <a href=\"http://lds.org/manual/young-women-manual-2?lang=eng\">are</a> <a href=\"http://lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-2?lang=eng\">some</a> <a href=\"http://lds.org/manual/primary?lang=eng\">examples</a> of manuals.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There provide for a more standardized curriculum and provide a way to disseminated shared institutional knowledge, both doctrinal and practical (good questions to ask when teaching a particular topic.)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Again, there is a tradeoff:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hew too closely to the manual and you neglect the special needs of your class and discussion becomes stilted because it&rsquo;s curtailed whenever not exactly on topic.</li>\n<li>Stray too far and the class becomes a forum for the teacher and/or eloquent class members to hold forth on their favorite topic-related points, which may or may not be helpful to the class as a whole.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, manuals provide a lower bound for teaching quality by giving inexperienced teachers basic ideas and jumping-off points.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The only way to figure out whether manuals are a good thing for Less Wrong is to include what works and see if good results can be replicated.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the most important but unassigned (unassignable?) roles is &lsquo;intelligent commenter&rsquo; &ndash; saying useful things in class discussion, taking the initiative and leading small group discussion, summarizing the group&rsquo;s discussion in useful form to the teacher afterwards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The best teachers aren&rsquo;t so much teachers as discussion moderators. But this is far from automatic, especially given the earlier discussion of teacher quality.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Less Wrong seems to use small groups, which work well as long as at least one &lsquo;intelligent commentator; ends up in each group. Without people trying to keep the discussion on track, it can roam around topics without actually going anywhere.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" href=\"#_ftn4\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[4]</span></span></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><strong>Auxiliaries</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is the men&rsquo;s organization and the women&rsquo;s organization. Sometimes there are other groups; for example, in my current church, there is a group of Stanford students, since about half of the church members are students there.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">(In &ldquo;family wards&rdquo; there are also organizations for the teenage boys and girls, plus one for younger children)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Basically: this is how you number the flock and make sure you don&rsquo;t forget about anyone. More about that later when I discuss leadership.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The men&rsquo;s organization divides the men in two and assigns each pair three to five people to visit monthly and watch out for. The women&rsquo;s organization similarly divides the women into pairs and assigns them to visit each other. This is called &ldquo;home teaching&rdquo; for men or &ldquo;visiting teaching&rdquo; for women.</p>\n<p>Home and visiting teachers are expected to be the first line of service if someone needs a ride to church or the airport, if their marriage is straining, if they end up in the hospital, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This helps most for those who don&rsquo;t live with other church members and for families. It is mostly redundant for those that are roommates with other church members.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Visiting rates are around sixty percent in my church unit (all young single adults), maybe forty percent overall. (That is, 40 or 60 percent of people are visited every month.)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The division is along age and gender lines because, as for age, the youth will naturally just divide that way anyway.</p>\n<p>As for gender, there&rsquo;s the obvious reason: a group of guys, or a group of girls, will talk about anything gender-related more freely than in mixed groups.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are also norms that place a high emphasis on a traditional family model. A single woman, a new mother, and a mother with her last kid on the way out the door are in different stages of the same role, and are well positioned to learn from and support each other. (Similarly with males.)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Groupings will likely slice differently in Less Wrong communities, of course.

Sequences) Don't Implement Themselves</a>, <a href=\"/lw/5o1/designing_rationalist_projects/\">Designing rationalist projects</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm beginning a new subseries of posts, trying to answer the following question: what should be the roles in a rationalist community?<span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In this post and the next one, I will outline the roles in Latter-day Saint communities. In the following posts, I will draw more conclusions as to which roles would be ideal for rationalist communities.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I should note that these sets of responsibilities are designed to function in congregations where 100 to 150 people come to church every week. They are slimmed down when the congregations are smaller. I\u2019m going to outline all the roles, and as I go, I\u2019ll note which ones are the most important.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong id=\"The_Main_Roles\">The Main Roles</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are four main groups of \u201ccallings,\u201d responsibilities in the church. I will discuss the first two groups in this post.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">First, there are the teachers, who speak, teach and lead discussions in Sunday church meetings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Second, there are auxiliaries, responsible for ensuring the well-being of the various segments of the congregation. In each congregation, there is a women\u2019s organization, a men\u2019s organization, as well as young women\u2019s, young men\u2019s, and children\u2019s organizations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In smaller groups, the leaders and more-committed members often wear multiple hats.<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em>Teachers</em></strong><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><strong>.</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Teachers [are] foot soldiers in the ongoing war against ignorance and complacency. Sunday worship is only as good and effective as the teaching.\" - Orson Scott Card. (<a href=\"http://www.mormontimes.com/article/19589/Are-there-silos-in-our-wards\">Link</a>, read the whole piece if you like this one.)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some members of the congregation are selected as regular teachers, who teach \u201cSunday school\u201d classes to everyone, for two hours of class every Sunday.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition, every week, three speakers from the congregation are assigned to give talks in the one-hour everyone-together \u201csacrament meeting\u201d. These rotate every week; people rarely give talks more than once every six months.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong id=\"Teacher_selection\">Teacher selection</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Qualifications? Interestingness and the ability to promote personal applications.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main enemy in church is simply boring-ness. Making a learning experience interesting is a nontrivial problem: visit your local school for evidence of that. This is even more where everybody is expected to teach, at some point.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Speakers in the everyone-together \u201csacrament meeting\u201d can drone on about favorite stories. Teachers can um and er their way through the lesson and ask bad questions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While selecting teachers, leaders must balance two conflicting objectives: interesting classes and skill development.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the one hand, if you pick the relatively confident, outgoing, intelligent people to teach, you\u2019re more likely to have interesting classes. On the other hand, if these people teach all the time, the others will never get a chance to learn to teach.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Why is learning to teach so important for everyone? Well, everyone has to teach their children.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"#_ftn1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[1]</span></span></a> Plus there are recruiting and career benefits.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The usual compromise is a mix of the two types. Some teachers are picked primarily so the classes will learn, and some are picked primarily so the teachers will learn.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" href=\"#_ftn2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[2]</span></span></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is supported by a shared norm/belief that the responsibility to learn lies with each individual; and you shouldn\u2019t blame a bad teacher. In a class focused on basic principles of living life, through sufficient humility and introspection, you can learn in any class, even given a less-articulate or educated teacher.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" href=\"#_ftn3\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[3]</span></span></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The norm is most clearly articulated by <a href=\"http://members.fortunecity.com/phantom1/books2/c._s._lewis_-_the_screwtape_letters.htm\">C.S. Lewis:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">an attitude which may, indeed, be critical in the sense of rejecting what is false or unhelpful, but which is wholly uncritical in the sense that it does not appraise\u2014does not waste time in thinking about what it rejects, but lays itself open in uncommenting, humble receptivity to any nourishment that is going. This attitude, especially during sermons, creates the condition in which platitudes can become really audible to a human soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong id=\"Manuals__\">Manuals. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The church, having been around for awhile, condensed the doctrine into a set of manuals. <a href=\"http://lds.org/manual/gospel-principles?lang=eng\">Here</a> <a href=\"http://lds.org/manual/young-women-manual-2?lang=eng\">are</a> <a href=\"http://lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-2?lang=eng\">some</a> <a href=\"http://lds.org/manual/primary?lang=eng\">examples</a> of manuals.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There provide for a more standardized curriculum and provide a way to disseminated shared institutional knowledge, both doctrinal and practical (good questions to ask when teaching a particular topic.)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Again, there is a tradeoff:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hew too closely to the manual and you neglect the special needs of your class and discussion becomes stilted because it\u2019s curtailed whenever not exactly on topic.</li>\n<li>Stray too far and the class becomes a forum for the teacher and/or eloquent class members to hold forth on their favorite topic-related points, which may or may not be helpful to the class as a whole.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, manuals provide a lower bound for teaching quality by giving inexperienced teachers basic ideas and jumping-off points.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The only way to figure out whether manuals are a good thing for Less Wrong is to include what works and see if good results can be replicated.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong id=\"Discussion\">Discussion</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the most important but unassigned (unassignable?) roles is \u2018intelligent commenter\u2019 \u2013 saying useful things in class discussion, taking the initiative and leading small group discussion, summarizing the group\u2019s discussion in useful form to the teacher afterwards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The best teachers aren\u2019t so much teachers as discussion moderators. But this is far from automatic, especially given the earlier discussion of teacher quality.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Less Wrong seems to use small groups, which work well as long as at least one \u2018intelligent commentator; ends up in each group. Without people trying to keep the discussion on track, it can roam around topics without actually going anywhere.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" href=\"#_ftn4\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[4]</span></span></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><strong>Auxiliaries</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is the men\u2019s organization and the women\u2019s organization. Sometimes there are other groups; for example, in my current church, there is a group of Stanford students, since about half of the church members are students there.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">(In \u201cfamily wards\u201d there are also organizations for the teenage boys and girls, plus one for younger children)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Basically: this is how you number the flock and make sure you don\u2019t forget about anyone. More about that later when I discuss leadership.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The men\u2019s organization divides the men in two and assigns each pair three to five people to visit monthly and watch out for. The women\u2019s organization similarly divides the women into pairs and assigns them to visit each other. This is called \u201chome teaching\u201d for men or \u201cvisiting teaching\u201d for women.</p>\n<p>Home and visiting teachers are expected to be the first line of service if someone needs a ride to church or the airport, if their marriage is straining, if they end up in the hospital, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This helps most for those who don\u2019t live with other church members and for families. It is mostly redundant for those that are roommates with other church members.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Visiting rates are around sixty percent in my church unit (all young single adults), maybe forty percent overall. (That is, 40 or 60 percent of people are visited every month.)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The division is along age and gender lines because, as for age, the youth will naturally just divide that way anyway.</p>\n<p>As for gender, there\u2019s the obvious reason: a group of guys, or a group of girls, will talk about anything gender-related more freely than in mixed groups.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are also norms that place a high emphasis on a traditional family model. A single woman, a new mother, and a mother with her last kid on the way out the door are in different stages of the same role, and are well positioned to learn from and support each other. (Similarly with males.)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Groupings will likely slice differently in Less Wrong communities, of course. Having a formal or informal woman\u2019s subgroup is probably a good idea, else the gender balance will probably continue to be, um, skewed.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" href=\"#_ftn5\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[5]</span></span></a></p>\n<div style=\"mso-element:footnote-list\"><br> \n<hr size=\"1\">\n<div id=\"ftn1\" style=\"mso-element:footnote\">\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn1\" name=\"_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftnref1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character: footnote\">[1]</span></span></a> This is a reasonably well-understood topic among Latter-day Saints.

This guy, Ray Kurzweil, who was the inventor of early synthesizers, he has this theory -- a few other people write about it too -- but essentially there's a point where artificial intelligence reaches beyond human intelligence and we fuse in with the internet and become what he calls \"spiritual machines.\" Essentially, you stop having to die and stop having to eat. Our physical form is no longer important because you're able to maintain your consciousness by uploading it to the next frame, which sounds spooky and weird but I think it's 100% achievable, especially when you think about how fast new machines invent newer machines, which invent the newer machines. It's exponential growth. A person doesn't have to sit down and invent every one of these steps. His vision is really utopian, like this is the way forward. Humans, we're obviously going to destroy our planet and destroy our physical form, but we'll continue in this way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hat tip to <a href=\"/user/Kevin/\">Kevin</a>.</p>",

And the people they mentor are most likely more compatible with them than the children that they'll most likely have (it's selection bias for compatibility, basically)</p>\n<p>That being said, maybe there is something psychological missing out from all this.

associate professor of computer science at the University of Utah, writes about two algorithmic optimizations for <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conway's Game of Life</a>, and speculates on the implications for self-aware entities in simulations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashlife\">Hashlife</a> is a clever optimization that treats the Life grid as a hierarchy of quadtrees. By observing that the maximum speed of signal propagation in a Life configuration is one cell per step, it becomes possible to evolve squares of the Life grid multiple steps into the future using hash codes. Hashlife is amazing to watch: it starts out slow but as the hashtable fills up, it suddenly &ldquo;explodes&rdquo; into exponential progress. I recommend <a href=\"http://golly.sourceforge.net/\">Golly</a>. Hashlife is one of my ten all-time favorite algorithms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those who have read Greg Egan's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City\">Permutation City</a> will find the concept of Hashlife familiar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another ingenious simulation speedup (developed, as it happens, around the same time as Hashlife) is <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/notes/2007/N1906.pdf\">Time Warp</a>, which relaxes the synchronization requirements, permitting a processor to run well ahead of its neighbors. This opens up the possibility that a processor will at some point receive a message that violates causality: it needs to be executed in the past. Clearly this is a problem. The solution is to roll back the simulation state to the time of the message and resume execution from there. If rollbacks are infrequent, overall performance may increase due to improved asynchrony. This is a form of &ldquo;optimistic concurrency&rdquo; and it can be shown to preserve the meaning of a simulation in the sense that the Time Warp implementation must always return the same final answer as the non-optimistic implementation.</p>\n</blockquote>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {"22z6XpWKqw3bNv4oR": 1}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "R8GvodpvYfLke6RBS", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 21, "baseScore": 28, "extendedScore": null, "score": 6e-05, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "8198", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 28, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": null, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 17, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-06-23T00:12:15.952Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "Being a lab rat for phase I trials for extended-release versions of drugs that are already well-known -

I got paid over $500 to test Concerta, which is basically the extended-release version of Ritalin (and it was one of the last stages too, even after it got FDA-approved). And Ritalin's effects are already very well-known.</p>\n<p>Many people are systematically prone to overestimating the risks from drugs (due to an intrinsic resistance to anything \"unnatural\"), especially since they don't do any research into them. Now, certainly, there is *some* chance that Phase I drugs could end up as disasters -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGN1412\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGN1412</a>&nbsp;foremost among them. And there's also a chance that you could end up with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosiglitazone\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosiglitazone</a>&nbsp;(but then, if you're only taking it for a few weeks, there probably won't be any permanent damage).</p>\n<p>But these are still the exceptions rather than the norm, and you're still probably more likely to die from a car accident. Furthermore, these types of things aren't going to happen to extended release forms (and the FDA still somehow requires stringent testing for new extended release forms of drugs). Some of us rationalists excel at doing research, and can easily estimate the risks of most drugs (and go straight into the journal papers to see relative ratios and LD50s [and the dose required to cause severe side effects in any human, which is usually much higher than the normal dose]). Furthermore, in the new era of genomic sequencing, we may even be able to better predict how our body will respond to these drugs (for example, we can see which receptors we're over-sensitive too, and which ones we're not so oversensitive to, as well as our expression of Cytochrome p450 enzymes). So maybe this is a potential windfall for some of us?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Especially in the future, since we're in the age where we are rapidly learning about biological networks?</p>\n<p>==</p>\n<p>Even

The location will be posted below, hopefully within 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p>For more details on how to get to the hackerspace, see my previous posts:\n<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/63k/houston_hackerspace_meetup_sunday_june_12_300pm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lesswrong.com/lw/63k/houston_hackerspace_meetup_sunday_june_12_300pm/</a></p>\n\n<p>To get to Brasil's, see its google page:\n<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Brasil+houston&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=Brasil&amp;hnear=0x8640b8b4488d8501:0xca0d02def365053b,Houston,+TX&amp;ei=AtACTv2gLojY0QGEtdXbCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_group&amp;ct=image&amp;ved=0CAQQtgM\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://maps.google.com/maps?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Brasil+houston&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=Brasil&amp;hnear=0x8640b8b4488d8501:0xca0d02def365053b,Houston,+TX&amp;ei=AtACTv2gLojY0QGEtdXbCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_group&amp;ct=image&amp;ved=0CAQQtgM</a></p></div>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .content -->\n\t\t<h2 id=\"Discussion_article_for_the_meetup___Houston__TX1\">Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/7\">Houston, TX</a></h2>", "sections": [{"title": "Discussion article for the meetup : Houston, TX", "anchor": "Discussion_article_for_the_meetup___Houston__TX", "level": 1}, {"title": "Discussion article for the meetup : Houston, TX", "anchor": "Discussion_article_for_the_meetup___Houston__TX1", "level": 1}, {"divider": true, "level": 0, "anchor": "postHeadingsDivider"}, {"anchor": "comments", "level": 0, "title": "3 comments"}], "headingsCount": 4}, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 3, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {"Posts": ["fjiZ2utAapw6zN4gt"]}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-06-23T06:03:46.201Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "They Changed It, Now It Sucks", "slug": "they-changed-it-now-it-sucks-0", "viewCount": null, "lastCommentedAt": "2017-06-17T03:59:28.039Z", "clickCount": null, "deletedDraft": false, "status": 2, "isFuture": false, "sticky": false, "stickyPriority": 2, "userIP": null, "userAgent": null, "referrer": null, "author": null, "user": {"username": "CaveJohnson", "createdAt": "2011-04-29T11:11:15.254Z", "isAdmin": false, "displayName": "CaveJohnson"}, "userId": "EK4shk2WdXy7LxDmB", "domain": null, "pageUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GEzYucnbtXyTTwy6e/they-changed-it-now-it-sucks-0", "pageUrlRelative": "/posts/GEzYucnbtXyTTwy6e/they-changed-it-now-it-sucks-0", "linkUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GEzYucnbtXyTTwy6e/they-changed-it-now-it-sucks-0", "postedAtFormatted": "Thursday, June 23rd 2011", "emailShareUrl": "mailto:?subject=Interesting%20link%3A%20They%20Changed%20It%2C%20Now%20It%20Sucks&body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20find%20this%20interesting%3A%0A%0AThey%20Changed%20It%2C%20Now%20It%20Sucks%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FGEzYucnbtXyTTwy6e%2Fthey-changed-it-now-it-sucks-0%0A%0A(found%20via%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com)%0A%20%20", "twitterShareUrl": "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=They%20Changed%20It%2C%20Now%20It%20Sucks%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FGEzYucnbtXyTTwy6e%2Fthey-changed-it-now-it-sucks-0", "facebookShareUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FGEzYucnbtXyTTwy6e%2Fthey-changed-it-now-it-sucks-0", "socialPreviewImageUrl": "", "question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 97, "htmlBody": "<p>Good now that <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks\">that's out of the way</a>, let me say I really like the new header, but replacing things like \"deleted\", \"report\" ect. with pictogram's&nbsp;is&nbsp;unnecessary in my opinion.</p>\n<p>The new nesting seems less aesthetically pleasing, though I think that is outweighed by it being easier to follow so that's a good change.</p>\n<p>Thumbs up and thumbs down however seems to me, to have a different implied meaning compared to up vote and down vote.

In the following posts, I will elaborate the analysis of implications.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Good sets of rules resemble programs; once developed, they can be made to run everywhere, with local modifications.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id: ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"#_ftn1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[1]</span></span></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the previous post, I discussed the role of teachers and auxiliaries. Teachers are the ones who speak, teach and lead discussions in Sunday church meetings. Auxiliaries are responsible for ensuring the well-being of the various segments of the congregation &ndash; men, women, and children.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In this post, I will discuss committees and leadership.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Committees are in charge of specific important tasks &ndash; planning activities, giving service, and so on. The general leadership appoints people to each of the positions, provides personal counseling, and plans the curriculum.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In smaller groups, the leaders and more-committed members often wear multiple hats.<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Committees </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a Latter-day Saint congregation, where 100 to 150 people come to church every week, there are a lot of committees. Committees are made up of male and female co-chairs and as many members as are necessary and available.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Fellowship Committee. </em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">This exists to help church members who move in become integrated into the ward. They follow up with leadership to make sure move-ins meet with church leadership, receive a calling (=responsibility), get home or visiting teachers, get a home or visiting teaching assignment, and so forth. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In family wards, they make sure that half the men&rsquo;s organization comes over on Sunday after church to load (or unload) the U-Haul. And that the women&rsquo;s organization brings over desserts, food, etc at some later time.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Missionary Committee</em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">. This helps new people start coming to meetings. For example, setting an example by inviting friends, encouraging people to invite their friends, thanking people for bringing their friends, befriending new people when they show up, making sure meeting topics are understandable to new people, asking last week&rsquo;s newcomer &ldquo;Hey, are you coming tomorrow?&rdquo; in the right way, and making sure that they are integrating into the social structure, similar to the fellowship committee.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mormons have a checklist for this one. If they&rsquo;re a new church member, they should have a friend, a responsibility, and be &ldquo;nourished by the good word of God,&rdquo; ie, they should be applying the principles they learn at church into their lives. Check check and check means we&rsquo;ve done our job.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Family Home Evening</em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">. This used to be my responsibility. Basically my co-chair and I would organize fun activities every Monday evening. For example: standard party games (Mafia, Psychiatrist, Pictionary), volleyball, a charity date auction. The ideal activities involved breaking up into small groups and competing on a task: a scavenger hunt, a marshmallow-and-toothpick bridge-building challenge.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Service, Temple, and Family History committees. </em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">These three committees are &ldquo;outward facing&rdquo; and merit mention. Service will organize days to clean a local park (or similar group task). Temple will organize trips to special buildings called temples. Family History will lend assistance in researching one&rsquo;s genealogy. Basically any church member can do these things; it requires no specialized knowledge. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Equivalent &ldquo;committees&rdquo; for Less Wrong could support, say, cryonics and Singularity, existential threat research. Of course, the tasks would have to be designed to require less specialized knowledge, similar to perhaps open-source hacking storms (a bunch of people spend 24 hours together writing code).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Housing</em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">. This one is simple but powerful. And it isn&rsquo;t even a committee, it&rsquo;s just one person who maintains a Google Doc of people looking for a place to live and people looking for roommates. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Consider: the church population in my church unit is entirely composed of young single adults. Over half of the church members who don&rsquo;t live with their parents live with each other. This, predictably, helps to build friendships. It probably increases the regularity of attending church meetings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Leadership</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As you might have guessed by now, one main function of the general congregation-level leadership is to make sure all of these gears are grinding smoothly.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Congregations are led by a bishop, who is chosen every five years from among the congregation. They are not paid &ndash; nor is anyone else in this structure. The bishop chooses two counselors, a secretary, and various clerks to keep the records and the books. He also selects the heads of each organization: men&rsquo;s organization, women&rsquo;s organization, teaching organization, committees.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Together with the bishop and his counselors, they choose which people should fulfill which roles.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A key concept in Latter-day Saint leadership is that of stewardship. As the name implies, the leaders have a spiritual responsibility over each member of their congregation. People have their agency, the freedom to choose, but the leaders have a charge to help them not go astray &ndash; ie, to keep coming to church, continue living the lifestyle. This responsibility is taken pretty seriously.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main unique role of the bishop is to provide personal counseling services for the congregation. It&rsquo;s understood that if you&rsquo;re struggling with addictions, having marital difficulties, or other personal problems, you should go talk to the bishop. Even when that&rsquo;s not the case, the system is set up so them you have some kind of interview with the bishop once or twice a year.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I&rsquo;ve had good experiences with this, just having designated time to talk privately with an older and wiser person. Think of it as a universal free counseling service.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Another role is to effectively oversee the workings of the congregation. As with most leaders, bishops consciously and unconsciously shape the culture.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If they bring or invite friends to church, others will too. If they express frustration at the eccentricities of newcomers, others will too. If they don&rsquo;t pay attention to new members and whether they are getting socially integrated into the church unit, others won&rsquo;t either.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If the bishop and his counselors create a high meeting quality, people are far more likely to bring their friends.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are various levels at which attrition operates; of which bishops and other leaders are well aware. These roles are also tools to help members not go astray.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The first level of attrition is that people stop coming because they don&rsquo;t have any friends. For church newcomers, if this is the case, will generally happen in the first couple months after they start coming.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Solution for bishops: seriously ask specific congregation members to befriend them. Have the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s organizations assign them high-quality home and visiting teachers.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The second level is when people haven&rsquo;t really applied church principles into their everyday lives. They might come for the friends, and they feel happy when they come, but they have no deep investment in the lifestyle.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Something will come up, it always does. Maybe they will get married to an uninterested spouse, maybe they&rsquo;re tired of constant snide remarks from disapproving family, maybe their new job has them work on Sunday, maybe a new set of friends who just have other things to do.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And so they stop coming.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Solution for bishops: ask them to accept a calling that gives them definite responsibilities and a place within a tightly-knit auxiliary or committee &ndash; say, Sunday School teacher for the 10 and 11-years olds.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The third level is a conscious, seriously considered decision by a longtime member to withdraw.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A lot of the time, maybe thirty to fifty percent, this is becoming \"offended\" and is due to decisions made or not made by the bishop. Perhaps he told them to do something they didn&rsquo;t like, or there was a dispute and he took the other side, or they feel ignored and unappreciated, or they just don&rsquo;t like his style of running the congregation.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" href=\"#_ftn2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[2]</span></span></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A good bishop is key to a healthy congregation.</p>\n<div style=\"mso-element:footnote-list\">\n<hr size=\"1\" />\n<div id=\"ftn1\" style=\"mso-element:footnote\">\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn1\" name=\"_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftnref1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character: footnote\">[1]</span></span></a> <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html\">Paul</a> <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html\">Graham</a>: &ldquo;The other way makers learn is from examples&hellip;hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at good programs-- not just at what they do, but the source code too.

And that the women\u2019s organization brings over desserts, food, etc at some later time.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Missionary Committee</em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">. This helps new people start coming to meetings. For example, setting an example by inviting friends, encouraging people to invite their friends, thanking people for bringing their friends, befriending new people when they show up, making sure meeting topics are understandable to new people, asking last week\u2019s newcomer \u201cHey, are you coming tomorrow?\u201d in the right way, and making sure that they are integrating into the social structure, similar to the fellowship committee.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mormons have a checklist for this one. If they\u2019re a new church member, they should have a friend, a responsibility, and be \u201cnourished by the good word of God,\u201d ie, they should be applying the principles they learn at church into their lives. Check check and check means we\u2019ve done our job.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Family Home Evening</em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">. This used to be my responsibility. Basically my co-chair and I would organize fun activities every Monday evening. For example: standard party games (Mafia, Psychiatrist, Pictionary), volleyball, a charity date auction. The ideal activities involved breaking up into small groups and competing on a task: a scavenger hunt, a marshmallow-and-toothpick bridge-building challenge.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Service, Temple, and Family History committees. </em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">These three committees are \u201coutward facing\u201d and merit mention. Service will organize days to clean a local park (or similar group task). Temple will organize trips to special buildings called temples. Family History will lend assistance in researching one\u2019s genealogy. Basically any church member can do these things; it requires no specialized knowledge. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Equivalent \u201ccommittees\u201d for Less Wrong could support, say, cryonics and Singularity, existential threat research. Of course, the tasks would have to be designed to require less specialized knowledge, similar to perhaps open-source hacking storms (a bunch of people spend 24 hours together writing code).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Housing</em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">. This one is simple but powerful. And it isn\u2019t even a committee, it\u2019s just one person who maintains a Google Doc of people looking for a place to live and people looking for roommates. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Consider: the church population in my church unit is entirely composed of young single adults. Over half of the church members who don\u2019t live with their parents live with each other. This, predictably, helps to build friendships. It probably increases the regularity of attending church meetings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong id=\"Leadership\">Leadership</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As you might have guessed by now, one main function of the general congregation-level leadership is to make sure all of these gears are grinding smoothly.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Congregations are led by a bishop, who is chosen every five years from among the congregation. They are not paid \u2013 nor is anyone else in this structure. The bishop chooses two counselors, a secretary, and various clerks to keep the records and the books. He also selects the heads of each organization: men\u2019s organization, women\u2019s organization, teaching organization, committees.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Together with the bishop and his counselors, they choose which people should fulfill which roles.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A key concept in Latter-day Saint leadership is that of stewardship. As the name implies, the leaders have a spiritual responsibility over each member of their congregation. People have their agency, the freedom to choose, but the leaders have a charge to help them not go astray \u2013 ie, to keep coming to church, continue living the lifestyle. This responsibility is taken pretty seriously.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main unique role of the bishop is to provide personal counseling services for the congregation. It\u2019s understood that if you\u2019re struggling with addictions, having marital difficulties, or other personal problems, you should go talk to the bishop. Even when that\u2019s not the case, the system is set up so them you have some kind of interview with the bishop once or twice a year.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I\u2019ve had good experiences with this, just having designated time to talk privately with an older and wiser person. Think of it as a universal free counseling service.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Another role is to effectively oversee the workings of the congregation. As with most leaders, bishops consciously and unconsciously shape the culture.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If they bring or invite friends to church, others will too. If they express frustration at the eccentricities of newcomers, others will too. If they don\u2019t pay attention to new members and whether they are getting socially integrated into the church unit, others won\u2019t either.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If the bishop and his counselors create a high meeting quality, people are far more likely to bring their friends.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are various levels at which attrition operates; of which bishops and other leaders are well aware. These roles are also tools to help members not go astray.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The first level of attrition is that people stop coming because they don\u2019t have any friends. For church newcomers, if this is the case, will generally happen in the first couple months after they start coming.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Solution for bishops: seriously ask specific congregation members to befriend them. Have the men\u2019s and women\u2019s organizations assign them high-quality home and visiting teachers.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The second level is when people haven\u2019t really applied church principles into their everyday lives. They might come for the friends, and they feel happy when they come, but they have no deep investment in the lifestyle.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Something will come up, it always does. Maybe they will get married to an uninterested spouse, maybe they\u2019re tired of constant snide remarks from disapproving family, maybe their new job has them work on Sunday, maybe a new set of friends who just have other things to do.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And so they stop coming.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Solution for bishops: ask them to accept a calling that gives them definite responsibilities and a place within a tightly-knit auxiliary or committee \u2013 say, Sunday School teacher for the 10 and 11-years olds.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The third level is a conscious, seriously considered decision by a longtime member to withdraw.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A lot of the time, maybe thirty to fifty percent, this is becoming \"offended\" and is due to decisions made or not made by the bishop. Perhaps he told them to do something they didn\u2019t like, or there was a dispute and he took the other side, or they feel ignored and unappreciated, or they just don\u2019t like his style of running the congregation.<a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" href=\"#_ftn2\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character:footnote\">[2]</span></span></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A good bishop is key to a healthy congregation.</p>\n<div style=\"mso-element:footnote-list\">\n<hr size=\"1\">\n<div id=\"ftn1\" style=\"mso-element:footnote\">\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><a style=\"mso-footnote-id:ftn1\" name=\"_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftnref1\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span style=\"mso-special-character: footnote\">[1]</span></span></a> <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html\">Paul</a> <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html\">Graham</a>: \u201cThe other way makers learn is from examples\u2026hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at good programs-- not just at what they do, but the source code too.

Extension and refinement of mathematical tools to enable rigorous formal analysis of advanced self-improving AI&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>For the practical aspect of the SIAI Research Program, we intend to take the <a href=\"http://metacog.org/doc.html\">MOSES probabilistic evolutionary learning system</a>, which exists in the public domain and was developed by <a href=\"http://metacog.org/research.html\">Dr. Moshe Looks</a> in his PhD work at Washington University in 2006, and deploy it  self-referentially, in a manner that allows MOSES to improve its own  learning methodology.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>Applying MOSES self-referentially will give us a fascinating concrete  example of self-modifying AI software &ndash; far short of human-level general  intelligence initially, but nevertheless with many lessons to teach us  about the more ambitious self-modifying AI&rsquo;s that may be possible.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>We are seeking additional funding so as to enable, initially, the hiring  of two doctoral or post-doctoral Research Fellows to focus on the above  two areas (practical and theoretical exploration of self-modifying AI).</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>Part of our goal is to make progress on these issues ourselves, in-house  within SIAI; and part of our goal is to, by demonstrating this  progress, interest the wider AI R&amp;D community in these foundational  issues.   Either way: the goal is to move toward a deeper understanding  of these incredibly important issues.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>SIAI must boot-strap into existence a scientific field and research  community for the study of safe, recursively self-improving systems;  this field and community doesn&rsquo;t exist yet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Has any progress been made on the points mentioned in the announcement above?</li>\n<li>Is the SIAI still willing to pursue experimental AI research or does it solely focus on hypothetical aspects?</li>\n<li>What would the SIAI do given various amounts of money?&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also have some questions regarding the hiring of experts. Is there a way to figure out what exactly the <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/aboutus/team\">current crew</a> is working on in terms of friendly AI research? Peter de Blanc seems to be the only person who has done some actual work related to artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>I am aware that preparatory groundwork has to be done and capital has to be raised. But <em>why is there no timeline? Why is there no progress report?</em> What is missing for the SIAI to actually start working on friendly AI? The Singularity Institute is 10 years old, what is planned for the decade ahead?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform":

abstract reasoning to arrive at conclusions. Can the relative success of philosophy versus mathematics provide empirical evidence for how robust our arguments must be before we can even hope to have a non-negligible chance of arriving at correct conclusions? Considering how bad philosophy has been at arriving at correct conclusions, must they not be essentially as robust as mathematical proof, or correct&nbsp;virtually&nbsp;with probability 1? If so, should this not cast severe doubt on arguments showing how, in expected utility calculations, outcomes with vast sums of utility can easily swamp a low probability of their coming to pass? Won't our estimates of such probabilities be severely inflated?</p>\n</p>\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a

Because \"Be specific\" is an <a href=\"/lw/5kz/the_5second_level/\">important rationalist skill</a>, and because concrete physical knowledge is important for <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Technical_explanation\">technical understanding</a> (as opposed to merely <em>verbal</em> understanding), I would like to summarize<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;some of&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;your beliefs become entangled with reality when a photon bounces off your shoelaces into your eye.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4>Vision</h4>\n<p>When a photon bounces off your shoelace and hits your eye, it passes through a lens whose curvature is adjusted by muscles that flatten the lens when they relax, allowing the eye to focus on more distant objects. The lens guides incoming photons such that a reverse image of the light patterns outside are projected on the back of the retina, which is populated largely by rod cells and cone cells.</p>\n<p>Rod cells are the most sensitive to light, and are the only photoreceptors used in low-light conditions (e.g., starlight). In lighter conditions (e.g. moonlight), both rods and cones contribute to vision. In daylight, rod responses saturate and only cones contribute to vision. Because the center of the retina (the fovea) contrains few rod cells, we have a foveal blind spot in dim conditions. Point your eyes <em>directly</em>&nbsp;at a dim star at nighttime and the star will disappear. Because we <em>understand</em>&nbsp;this 'flaw' in the human vision system, we have further reason to believe that stars do not <em>actually</em>&nbsp;disappear when our eyes look directly at them. The human brain is <a href=\"/lw/jm/the_lens_that_sees_its_flaws/\">the lens that sees its flaws</a>.</p>\n<p>In rod cells, the translation of photon wavelength to bioelectric <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential\">action potentials</a> occurs when a photon strikes a protein molecule called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin\">opsin</a>&nbsp;in the outer section of a rod cell. This molecule has been sequenced and cloned in many species, and is understood at the atomic level.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1613885012/eye-diagram-690px_fadili.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"434\"></p>\n<p><small>Summary diagram of the primate retina.

(Click image for full size.)</small></p>\n<p>The photon's energy is absorbed by a photosensitive chemical in the opsin called rhodopsin, and in particular a molecule in rhodopsin called 11-cis-retinal. This is a quantum event that drives the 11-cis-retinal molecule into a higher energy state, which affects its 3D shape. The increase in energy shifts the 11-cis-retinal (an angulated molecule) into all-trans-retinal (a straight molecule). This unstable shape provokes a cascade of biochemical events which ends with the closing of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel\">ion channels</a> in the rod cell membrane that are permeable to sodium. Because charged sodium ions can no longer drive the cell membrane voltage higher, the cell membrane's voltage drops.</p>\n<p>This produces an electric current along the cell. More light leads to more rhodopsin activation, which leads to more electric current. This electrical impulse reaches a ganglion cell, and then an optic nerve. Signals from all points on the retina are passed in this way along nerve cells to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_geniculate_nucleus\">lateral geniculate nucleus</a> (LGN) in the thalamus.</p>\n<p>The LGN in humans has six layers, and information from particular parts of each eye are sent to particular layers of the LGN in what is called 'topographical organization.' These signals are then passed to the primary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex\">visual cortex</a> in the occipital lobe.&nbsp;Adjacent regions of retina are&nbsp;connected to adjacent neurons in the visual cortex.&nbsp;Damage to a&nbsp;region of visual cortex causes loss of vision in the part of the visual field captured by the part of the retina connected to the damaged part of the visual cortex. This partial loss of vision is called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotoma\">scotoma</a>. An example of signal mapping from visual field to retina to visual cortex is shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/scene-to-retina-visual-cortex.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><small>Image taken from Frisby &amp; Stone (2010), p. 6, which explains: \"The hyperfields are regions of&nbsp;the retinal image that project to hypothetical structures called hypercolumns (denoted as graph-paper squares in the part&nbsp;of the striate cortex map shown here, which derives from the left hand sides of the left and right retinal images). Hyperfields are much smaller in central than in peripheral vision, so relatively more cells are devoted to&nbsp;central vision. Hyperfields have receptive fields in both images but here two are shown for the right image only.\"</small></p>\n<p>Many neurons in the visual cortex are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_detection_(nervous_system)\">feature detectors</a> because of their ability to respond to edges, lines, angles, and movements in visual information coming from ganglion cells in the retina. These feature detectors pass information to 'supercell clusters' of neurons that process the detected features in the visual field for more complex patterns, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception\">faces</a> (detected by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusiform_gyrus\">fusiform gyrus</a> and other structures in the human brain).</p>\n<p>Some of this information is sent through unconscious processing pathways that may trigger action in the motor cortex (as when a baseball flying toward your head suddenly comes into view and you duck). Other parts of the information is sent to conscious processing pathways that make you aware of what you are seeing.

It tells us which sorts of thinking processes tend to create beliefs that mirror reality, and which ones don't.</p>\n<p>Still, not everyone understands just how <em>much</em>&nbsp;we know about <em>exactly</em> how the brain becomes entangled with reality by chains of cause and effect. Because \"Be specific\" is an <a href=\"/lw/5kz/the_5second_level/\">important rationalist skill</a>, and because concrete physical knowledge is important for <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Technical_explanation\">technical understanding</a> (as opposed to merely <em>verbal</em> understanding), I would like to summarize<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;some of&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;your beliefs become entangled with reality when a photon bounces off your shoelaces into your eye.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4 id=\"Vision\">Vision</h4>\n<p>When a photon bounces off your shoelace and hits your eye, it passes through a lens whose curvature is adjusted by muscles that flatten the lens when they relax, allowing the eye to focus on more distant objects. The lens guides incoming photons such that a reverse image of the light patterns outside are projected on the back of the retina, which is populated largely by rod cells and cone cells.</p>\n<p>Rod cells are the most sensitive to light, and are the only photoreceptors used in low-light conditions (e.g., starlight). In lighter conditions (e.g. moonlight), both rods and cones contribute to vision. In daylight, rod responses saturate and only cones contribute to vision. Because the center of the retina (the fovea) contrains few rod cells, we have a foveal blind spot in dim conditions. Point your eyes <em>directly</em>&nbsp;at a dim star at nighttime and the star will disappear. Because we <em>understand</em>&nbsp;this 'flaw' in the human vision system, we have further reason to believe that stars do not <em>actually</em>&nbsp;disappear when our eyes look directly at them. The human brain is <a href=\"/lw/jm/the_lens_that_sees_its_flaws/\">the lens that sees its flaws</a>.</p>\n<p>In rod cells, the translation of photon wavelength to bioelectric <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential\">action potentials</a> occurs when a photon strikes a protein molecule called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin\">opsin</a>&nbsp;in the outer section of a rod cell. This molecule has been sequenced and cloned in many species, and is understood at the atomic level.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1613885012/eye-diagram-690px_fadili.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"434\"></p>\n<p><small>Summary diagram of the primate retina.

(Click image for full size.)</small></p>\n<p>The photon's energy is absorbed by a photosensitive chemical in the opsin called rhodopsin, and in particular a molecule in rhodopsin called 11-cis-retinal. This is a quantum event that drives the 11-cis-retinal molecule into a higher energy state, which affects its 3D shape. The increase in energy shifts the 11-cis-retinal (an angulated molecule) into all-trans-retinal (a straight molecule). This unstable shape provokes a cascade of biochemical events which ends with the closing of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel\">ion channels</a> in the rod cell membrane that are permeable to sodium. Because charged sodium ions can no longer drive the cell membrane voltage higher, the cell membrane's voltage drops.</p>\n<p>This produces an electric current along the cell. More light leads to more rhodopsin activation, which leads to more electric current. This electrical impulse reaches a ganglion cell, and then an optic nerve. Signals from all points on the retina are passed in this way along nerve cells to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_geniculate_nucleus\">lateral geniculate nucleus</a> (LGN) in the thalamus.</p>\n<p>The LGN in humans has six layers, and information from particular parts of each eye are sent to particular layers of the LGN in what is called 'topographical organization.' These signals are then passed to the primary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex\">visual cortex</a> in the occipital lobe.&nbsp;Adjacent regions of retina are&nbsp;connected to adjacent neurons in the visual cortex.&nbsp;Damage to a&nbsp;region of visual cortex causes loss of vision in the part of the visual field captured by the part of the retina connected to the damaged part of the visual cortex. This partial loss of vision is called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotoma\">scotoma</a>. An example of signal mapping from visual field to retina to visual cortex is shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/scene-to-retina-visual-cortex.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><small>Image taken from Frisby &amp; Stone (2010), p. 6, which explains: \"The hyperfields are regions of&nbsp;the retinal image that project to hypothetical structures called hypercolumns (denoted as graph-paper squares in the part&nbsp;of the striate cortex map shown here, which derives from the left hand sides of the left and right retinal images). Hyperfields are much smaller in central than in peripheral vision, so relatively more cells are devoted to&nbsp;central vision. Hyperfields have receptive fields in both images but here two are shown for the right image only.\"</small></p>\n<p>Many neurons in the visual cortex are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_detection_(nervous_system)\">feature detectors</a> because of their ability to respond to edges, lines, angles, and movements in visual information coming from ganglion cells in the retina. These feature detectors pass information to 'supercell clusters' of neurons that process the detected features in the visual field for more complex patterns, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception\">faces</a> (detected by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusiform_gyrus\">fusiform gyrus</a> and other structures in the human brain).</p>\n<p>Some of this information is sent through unconscious processing pathways that may trigger action in the motor cortex (as when a baseball flying toward your head suddenly comes into view and you duck). Other parts of the information is sent to conscious processing pathways that make you aware of what you are seeing.

Computation, communication, synchronization, and memory all need various resources, which in turn are limited by the physical arrangements of the devices. The sought-after bridging model has to account for these costs. We have been spoiled over the last 60-odd years by having an abstraction as simple as the von Neumann model suffice.

Memorizing a new word is easy enough for a computer, but it is still mysterious how the brain does it.

possible explanations. One is that something has gone wrong in the  external world &mdash; maybe the bulb has burned out. Alternatively, you may  have made a mistake, perhaps flipping the wrong switch.</p>\n<p>Infants can integrate prior knowledge with statistical data to make these distinctions at a very young age [...] 16-month-old infants can, based on very little information, make  accurate judgments of whether a failed action is due their own mistake  or to circumstances beyond their control.</p>\n<p>[...]  very young infants can quickly learn basic principles about how the  world works, then use those rules to interpret the statistical evidence  they see. [...]&nbsp; &ldquo;They can use very, very sparse evidence because they have these rich  prior beliefs and they can use that to make quite sophisticated, quite  accurate inferences about the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In one condition, babies saw a toy that played music when one  experimenter pushed a button on the toy but failed when a second  experimenter tried, suggesting that the failure was due to the agent. In  another condition, the button sometimes activated the toy and sometimes  failed for each of the two experimenters, suggesting that something was  wrong with the toy.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>Depending on the circumstances of the experiment, the babies did respond  differently, indicating that they were able to weigh evidence for each  explanation and react accordingly. Infants who saw evidence suggesting  the agent had failed tried to hand the toy to their parents for help,  suggesting the babies assumed the failure was their own fault.  Conversely, babies who saw evidence suggesting that the toy was broken  were more likely to reach for a new toy (a red one that was always  within reach).</p>\n<p>[...] 16-month-olds could use very limited evidence (the distribution of  outcomes across the experimenters&rsquo; actions) to infer the source of  failure and decide whether to ask for help or seek another toy. That  finding lends strong support to the probabilistic inferential learning  model.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What the finding here seems to be is kids are smart, but the way in  which they&rsquo;re smart is really tracking statistics. They&rsquo;re really good  learners,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a

&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This Article presents two new arguments against &ldquo;discounting&rdquo; future  human lives during cost-benefit analysis, arguing that even absent  ethical objections to the disparate treatment of present and future  humanity, the economic calculations of cost-benefit analysis itself - if  properly calculated - counsel against discounting lives at anything  close to current rates.  In other words, even if society sets aside all  concerns with the discounting of future generations in principle,  current discounting of future human lives cannot be justified even on  the discounters&rsquo; own terms.  First, because cost-benefit analysis has  thus far ignored evidence of rising health care expenditures, it  underestimates the &ldquo;willingness to pay&rdquo; for health and safety that  future citizens will likely exhibit, thereby undervaluing their lives.   Second, cost-benefit analysis ignores the trend of improved material  conditions in developed countries.  As time advances, residents of rich  countries tend to live better and spend more, meaning that a strict  economic monetization of future persons values the lives of our expected  descendents above those of present citizens.  These two factors justify  &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; of future lives that would offset, perhaps completely, the  discount rate used for human life.  Until regulators correct their  method of discounting the benefits of saving human lives in the future,  the United States will continue to suffer the fatal costs of  underregulation, and agencies will remain in violation of legal  requirements to maximize net benefits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a

href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Psychology-Handbook-John-Doris/dp/0199582149/\">The Moral Psychology Handbook</a>&nbsp;(2010),&nbsp;edited by John Doris, is probably the best way to become familiar with the exciting interdisciplinary field of <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-psych-emp/\">moral psychology</a>. The chapters are written by philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists. A few of them are all three, and the university department to which they are assigned is largely arbitrary.</p>\n<p>I should also note that the chapter authors happen to comprise a large chunk of my own 'moral philosophers who don't totally suck' list. The book is also exciting because it undermines or outright falsifies a long list of popular philosophical theories with - gasp! - <em>empirical evidence</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 1: <em>Evolution of Morality</em>&nbsp;(Machery &amp; Mallon)</h4>\n<p>The authors examine three interpretations of the claim that morality evolved. The claims \"Some components of moral psychology evolved\" and \"Normative cognition is a product of evolution\" are empirically well-supported but philosophically uninteresting. The stronger claim that \"Moral cognition (a kind of normative cognition) evolved\" is more philosophically interesting, but at present not strongly supported by the evidence (according to the authors).</p>\n<p>The chapter serves as a compact survey of recent models for the evolution of morality in humans (Joyce, Hauser, de Waal, etc.), and attempts to draw philosophical conclusions about morality from these descriptive models (e.g. Joyce, Street).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 2: <em>Multi-system Moral Psychology</em>&nbsp;(Cushman, Young, &amp; Greene)</h4>\n<p>The authors survey the psychological and neuroscientific evidence showing that moral judgments are both intuitive/affective/unconscious and rational/cognitive/conscious, and propose a dual-process theory of moral judgment. Scientific data is used to verify or falsify philosophical theories proposed as, for example, explanations for trolley-problem cases.</p>\n<p>Consequentialist moral judgments are more associated with rational thought than deontological judgment, but both deontological and consequentialist moral judgments have their sources in emotion. Deontological judgments are associated with 'alarm bell' emotions that circumvent reasoning and provide absolute demands on behavior. Alarm bell emotions are rooted in (for example) the amygdala. Consequentialist judgments are associated with 'currency' emotions provide negotiable motivations that weigh for and against particular behaviors, and are rooted in meso-limbic regions that track a stimulus' reward magnitude, reward probability, and expected value.</p>\n<p>This chapter might be the best one in the book.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 3: <em>Moral Motivation</em> (Schroeder, Roskies, &amp; Nichols)</h4>\n<p>The authors categorize philosophical theories of moral motivation into four groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Instrumentalists</em>&nbsp;think people are motivated when they form beliefs about how to satisfy pre-existing desires.</li>\n<li><em>Cognitivists</em>&nbsp;think people are motivated <em>merely</em>&nbsp;by the belief that something is right or wrong.</li>\n<li><em>Sentimentalists</em>&nbsp;think people are morally motivated only by emotions.</li>\n<li><em>Personalists</em>&nbsp;think people are motivated by their character: their knowledge of good and bad, their wanting for good or bad, their emotions about good or bad, and their habits of responding to these three.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The authors then argue that the neuroscience of motivation fits best with the instrumentalist and personalist pictures of moral motivation, poses some problems for sentimentalists, and presents grave problems for cognitivists. The main weakness of the chapter is that its picture of the neuroscience of motivation is mostly drawn from a decade-old neuroscience textbook. As such, the chapter misses many new developments, especially the important discoveries occurring in <a href=\"/lw/4z7/the_neuroscience_of_desire/\">neuroeconomics</a>. Still, I can personally attest that the latest neuroscience still comes down most strongly in favor of instrumentalists and personalists, but there are recent details that could have been included in this chapter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 4: <em>Moral Emotions</em> (Prinz &amp; Nichols)</h4>\n<p>The authors survey studies that illuminate the role of emotions in moral cognition, and discuss several models that have been proposed, concluding that the evidence currently respects each of them. They then focus on a more detailed discussion of two emotions that are particularly causal in the moral judgments of Western society: anger and guilt.</p>\n<p>The chapter is strong in example experiments, but a higher-level discussion of the role of emotions in moral judgment is provided by chapter 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 5: <em>Altruism</em> (Stich, Doris, &amp; Roedder)</h4>\n<p>The authors distinguish four kinds of desires: (1) desires for pleasure and avoiding pain, (2) self-interested desires, (3) desires that are not self-interested and no for the well-being of others, and (4) desires for the well-being of others. Psychological hedonism maintains that all (<a href=\"/lw/l4/terminal_values_and_instrumental_values/\">terminal, as opposed to instrumental</a>) desires are of type 1. Psychological egoism says that all desires are of type 2 (which includes type 1). Altruism claims that <em>some</em>&nbsp;desires fall into category 4. And if there are desires of tyep 3 but none of type 4, then both egoism and altruism are false.</p>\n<p>The authors survey evolutionary arguments for and against altruism, but are not yet convinced by any of them.</p>\n<p>Psychology, however, <em>does</em>&nbsp;support the existence of altruism, which seems to be \"the product of an emotional response to another's distress.\" The authors survey the experimental evidence, especially the work of Batson. They conclude there is significant support for the existence of genuine human altruism. <a href=\"/lw/kx/fake_selfishness/\">We are not motivated by selfishness alone</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 6: <em>Moral Reasoning</em> (Harman, Mason, &amp; Sinnott-Armstrong)</h4>\n<p>The authors clarify the roles of conscious and unconscious moral reasoning, and reject one popular theory of moral reasoning: the deductive model. One of many reasons for their rejection of the deductive model is that it assumes we come to explicit moral conclusions by applying logic, probability theory, and decision theory to pre-existing moral principles, but in the deductive model these principles are understood in terms of psychological theories of concepts that are probably false. The authors survey the 'classical view of concepts' (concepts as defined in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions) and conclude that it is less likely to be true than alternate theories of mental concepts that are less friendly to the deductive model of moral reasoning.</p>\n<p>The authors propose an alternate model of moral reasoning whereby one makes mutual adjustments to one's beliefs and plans and values in pursuit of what Rawls called 'reflective equilibrium.'</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 7: <em>Moral Intuitions</em> (Sinnott-Armstrong, Young, &amp; Cushman)</h4>\n<p>The authors refer to moral intuitions as \"strong, stable, immediate moral beliefs.\" The 'immediate' part means that these moral beliefs do not arise through conscious reasoning; the subject is conscious only of the resulting moral belief.</p>\n<p>Their project is this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...moral intuitions are unreliable to the extent that morally irrelevant factors affect moral intuitions. When they are distorted by irrelevant factors, moral intuitions can be likened to mirages or seeing pink elephants while one is on LSD. Only when beliefs arise in more reputable ways do they have a fighting chance of being justified. Hence we need to know about the processes that produce moral intuitions before we can determine whether moral intuitions are justified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus the chapter engages in something like Less Wrong-style 'dissolution to algorithm.'</p>\n<p>A major weakness of this article is that it focuses on the understanding of intuitions as <a href=\"/lw/531/how_you_make_judgments_the_elephant_and_its_rider/\">attribute substitution heuristics</a>, but ignores the other two major sources of intuitive judgments: <a href=\"/lw/5bw/your_evolved_intuitions/\">evolutionary psychology</a> and <a href=\"/lw/59v/intuition_and_unconscious_learning/\">unconscious associative learning</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 8: <em>Linguistics and Moral Theory</em> (Roedder &amp; Harman)</h4>\n<p>This chapter examines the 'linguistic analogy' in moral psychology - the analogy between Chomsky's 'universal grammar' and what has been called 'universal moral grammar.' The authors don't have any strong conclusions, but instead suggest that this linguistic analogy may be a helpful framework for pursuing further research. They list five ways in particular the analogy is useful. This chapter can be skipped without missing much.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 9: <em>Rules</em> (Mallon &amp; Nichols)</h4>\n<p>The authors survey the evidence that moral rules \"are mentally represented and play a causal role in the production of judgment and behavior.\" This may be obvious, but it's nice to have the evidence collected somewhere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 10: <em>Responsibility</em> (Knobe &amp; Doris)</h4>\n<p>This chapter surveys the experimental studies that test people's attributions of moral responsibility. In short, people do not make such judgments according to invariant principles, as assumed by most of 20th century moral philosophy. (Moral philosophers have spent most of their time trying to find a set of principles that accounted for people's ordinary moral judgments, and showing that alternate sets of principles failed to capture people's ordinary moral judgments in particular circumstances.)</p>\n<p>People adopt different moral criteria for judging different cases, even when they verbally endorse a simple set of abstract principles. This should not be surprising, as the same had already been shown to be true in linguistics and in non-moral judgment. The chapter surveys the variety of ways in which people adopt different moral criteria for different cases.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 11: <em>Character</em> (Merritt, Doris, &amp; Harman)</h4>\n<p>This chapter surveys the evidence from <a href=\"/lw/52g/the_good_news_of_situationist_psychology/\">situationist psychology</a>, which undermines the 'robust character traits' view of human psychology upon which many varieties of virtue ethics depend.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 12: <em>Well-Being</em> (Tiberius &amp; Plakias)</h4>\n<p>This chapter surveys competing concepts of 'well-being' in psychology, and provides reasons for using the 'life satisfaction' concept of well-being, especially in philosophy. The authors then discuss life satisfaction and normativity; for example the worry about the arbitrariness of factors that lead to human life satisfaction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Chapter 13: <em>Race and Racial Cognition</em> (Kelly, Machery, &amp; Mallon)</h4>\n<p>I didn't read this chapter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {"4Kcm4etxAJjmeDkHP": 2, "nSHiKwWyMZFdZg5qt": 2, "JsJPrdgRGRqnci8cZ": 2, "DLskYNGdAGDFpxBF8": 2, "yeJFqsWrP2pjYfNEr": 2, "ZTRNmvQGgoYiymYnq": 2}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "KPEMeKRHNG4wXkZ72", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 17, "baseScore": 24, "extendedScore": null, "score": 7.33034238948992e-07, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "8277", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 16, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": {"html": "<p><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Psychology-Handbook-John-Doris/dp/0199582149/\">The Moral Psychology Handbook</a>&nbsp;(2010),&nbsp;edited by John Doris, is probably the best way to become familiar with the exciting interdisciplinary field of <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-psych-emp/\">moral psychology</a>. The chapters are written by philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists. A few of them are all three, and the university department to which they are assigned is largely arbitrary.</p>\n<p>I should also note that the chapter authors happen to comprise a large chunk of my own 'moral philosophers who don't totally suck' list. The book is also exciting because it undermines or outright falsifies a long list of popular philosophical theories with - gasp! - <em>empirical evidence</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Chapter_1__Evolution_of_Morality__Machery___Mallon_\">Chapter 1: <em>Evolution of Morality</em>&nbsp;(Machery &amp; Mallon)</h4>\n<p>The authors examine three interpretations of the claim that morality evolved. The claims \"Some components of moral psychology evolved\" and \"Normative cognition is a product of evolution\" are empirically well-supported but philosophically uninteresting. The stronger claim that \"Moral cognition (a kind of normative cognition) evolved\" is more philosophically interesting, but at present not strongly supported by the evidence (according to the authors).</p>\n<p>The chapter serves as a compact survey of recent models for the evolution of morality in humans (Joyce, Hauser, de Waal, etc.), and attempts to draw philosophical conclusions about morality from these descriptive models (e.g. Joyce, Street).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Chapter_2__Multi_system_Moral_Psychology__Cushman__Young____Greene_\">Chapter 2: <em>Multi-system Moral Psychology</em>&nbsp;(Cushman, Young, &amp; Greene)</h4>\n<p>The authors survey the psychological and neuroscientific evidence showing that moral judgments are both intuitive/affective/unconscious and rational/cognitive/conscious, and propose a dual-process theory of moral judgment. Scientific data is used to verify or falsify philosophical theories proposed as, for example, explanations for trolley-problem cases.</p>\n<p>Consequentialist moral judgments are more associated with rational thought than deontological judgment, but both deontological and consequentialist moral judgments have their sources in emotion. Deontological judgments are associated with 'alarm bell' emotions that circumvent reasoning and provide absolute demands on behavior. Alarm bell emotions are rooted in (for example) the amygdala. Consequentialist judgments are associated with 'currency' emotions provide negotiable motivations that weigh for and against particular behaviors, and are rooted in meso-limbic regions that track a stimulus' reward magnitude, reward probability, and expected value.</p>\n<p>This chapter might be the best one in the book.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Chapter_3__Moral_Motivation__Schroeder__Roskies____Nichols_\">Chapter 3: <em>Moral Motivation</em> (Schroeder, Roskies, &amp; Nichols)</h4>\n<p>The authors categorize philosophical theories of moral motivation into four groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Instrumentalists</em>&nbsp;think people are motivated when they form beliefs about how to satisfy pre-existing desires.</li>\n<li><em>Cognitivists</em>&nbsp;think people are motivated <em>merely</em>&nbsp;by the belief that something is right or wrong.</li>\n<li><em>Sentimentalists</em>&nbsp;think people are morally motivated only by emotions.</li>\n<li><em>Personalists</em>&nbsp;think people are motivated by their character: their knowledge of good and bad, their wanting for good or bad, their emotions about good or bad, and their habits of responding to these three.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The authors then argue that the neuroscience of motivation fits best with the instrumentalist and personalist pictures of moral motivation, poses some problems for sentimentalists, and presents grave problems for cognitivists. The main weakness of the chapter is that its picture of the neuroscience of motivation is mostly drawn from a decade-old neuroscience textbook. As such, the chapter misses many new developments, especially the important discoveries occurring in <a href=\"/lw/4z7/the_neuroscience_of_desire/\">neuroeconomics</a>.

The first to be released, \"CV01 - Hatsune Miku\" became runaway success, as thousands of internet users started making their songs with Hatsune Miku.

humans are too stupid to see coming.</p>\n<p>-have a discussion between it and a group of ethicists/philosophers wherein both parties are encouraged to point out any flaws in the definition.</p>\n<p>-have this go on for a long time until everyone (especially the AI, seeing as it is smarter than anyone else) is certain that there is no flaw in the definition and that it

preferences -- I fold to the preferences of the most moral minority.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I don't personally find <em>X</em> to be intrinsically immoral. I know that if some people knew this about me, they might feel shocked, sad and disgusted. I can understand how they would feel because I feel that Y is immoral and not everyone does, even though they should.</p>\n<p>These are unpleasant feelings and, combined with the fear that immoral events will happen more frequently due to apathy,&nbsp; I'm willing to fold <em>X</em> into my category of things that shouldn't happen. Not because of <em>X</em> itself, but because I know it makes people feel bad.</p>\n<p>This is more than the gaming strategy I'll be anti-<em>X</em> if they'll be anti-<em>Y</em>. This is a reflection that the most moral world is a world in which people's moral preferences are maximally satisfied, so that no one needs to feel that their morality is marginalized and suffer the feelings of disgust and sadness.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Application: Nested Morality Model</strong></p>\n<p>The sentiment and strategy just described is ideal in the case of a nested model of moralities in which preferences can be roughly universally ranked from most immoral to least immoral: <em>X<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>X<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>X<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>X<sub>4</sub></em>, ... . Every one has an immoral threshold where they no longer care. For example, all humans consider the first few elements to be immoral. However, only the most morally sensitive humans care about the elements after the first few thousand. In such a world where this model was accurate, it would be ideal to fold to the morality of the most morally sensitive. Not only would you be satisfying the morality of everyone, you could be certain that you were also satisfying the morality of your most moral, future selves, especially by extending the fold a little further out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_6er_0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"183\" /></p>\n<p><em><strong>Figure: Hierarchy of Moral Preferences in the Nested Morality Model<br /></strong></em></p>\n<p>Note that in this model it doesn't actually matter if individual humans would rank the preferences differently. Since they're all satisfied, the ordering of preferences doesn't matter. Folding to the most moral minority should solve all moral conflicts that result from varying sensitivity to a moral issue, regardless of differences in relative rankings. For example, by such a strategy I should become a vegetarian (although I'm not).</p>\n<p><strong>Real Life Application: Very Limited</strong></p>\n<p>However, in reality, moral preferences aren't nested in sensitivity, but conflicting.

I know that if some people knew this about me, they might feel shocked, sad and disgusted.

Every one has an immoral threshold where they no longer care. For example, all humans consider the first few elements to be immoral. However, only the most morally sensitive humans care about the elements after the first few thousand. In such a world where this model was accurate, it would be ideal to fold to the morality of the most morally sensitive. Not only would you be satisfying the morality of everyone, you could be certain that you were also satisfying the morality of your most moral, future selves, especially by extending the fold a little further out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_6er_0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"183\"></p>\n<p><em><strong>Figure: Hierarchy of Moral Preferences in the Nested Morality Model<br></strong></em></p>\n<p>Note that in this model it doesn't actually matter if individual humans would rank the preferences differently.

Of those deaths, about 1/3rd were prevented by existing donors. We'd be preventing less than 2% of all deaths in Canada if everyone got the donations they needed.</p>\n<p>Donation is only viable in cases of brain death (~49% odds) [1], and I couldn't find any statistics on how often a donor body is actually usable (but I'd assume vastly less than 100% of those cases, since you have to die of brain death in a hospital and still have cardiac activity) All in all, there's a deficit of donors, so it's probably still helpful (unless you're a male who has had sex with another male, in which case you might not even be legally eligible; it's banned in Canada).</p>\n<p>I think you're probably saving less than 1 life on average by being a donor. You'd probably do better to convince some friends and co-workers to sign up with, since organ donation is \"low hanging fruit\" (free, socially acceptable), and sign yourself up for cryonics (you can claim you've gone with the more complex \"donate body to medical science\" if you need a social excuse for why you're not an organ donor yourself)</p>\n<p>If you're <strong>not</strong> doing cryonics, there's no excuse for not being an organ donor, of course, so don't use this as an excuse to wiggle out of doing one or the other! :)</p>\n<p>[1] http://www.transplant.ca/pubinfo_orgtiss.htm</p>\n<p>[2] http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo07a-eng.htm</p>\n</div>\n</div>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": null, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "wGNxep774ZAmwB8Ge", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 10, "baseScore": 9, "extendedScore": null, "score": 1.8e-05, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "8315", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 9, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": null, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 29, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-06-27T21:13:45.580Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "Start the week -

Only recently have religions attempted to be non-disprovable by confining themselves to ethical claims.

target=\"_blank\">Pascal's Mugging</a>, it stuck in my brain. &nbsp;I knew that I had seen something like this occur in real life, though I couldn't quite place the specifics at the time. &nbsp;Then it hit me- chain letters are a classical example of this. &nbsp;They promise that if you copy the letter X times and distribute it, you will have good luck, your hair will grow back, etc., but if you don't distribute it, you will have bad luck, pianos will fall on you, etc. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I thought a little bit further about this, because I knew I hadn't originally gotten bothered about this sort of thing because of chain letters (no one sends actual mail anymore); chain letters are just the obvious example that will occur after five minutes of thought. &nbsp;The actual thing that had stuck in my brain was a phenomenon particular to the internet. &nbsp;On Youtube and 4chan, there are often messages posted at least superficially similar to the following:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">In [year], [someone] was killed after [spectacularly gruesome details]. &nbsp;Post a copy of this message in the next 10 minutes, or the ghost of [someone] will find you tonight and [spectacularly gruesome details]. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>These threads have hundreds of replies almost every time that I see them &nbsp;on 4chan, and on Youtube they spread from one video to the next while actual comments become buried. &nbsp;This demonstrates that at least a significant fraction of the people that see these make the mental calculation that if they do not post it, they have a small chance of suffering incredible disutility, but if they do post it, they suffer only a few seconds of lost time. &nbsp;(They're also much more effective at spreading than chain letters because the transmission time and cost of spreading are much less than with chain letters).</p>\n<p>This is one of the best examples of real-life Pascalian muggings that I've found and one of the arguments for the benefits of raising the sanity waterline- the lost man-hours to this sort of thing may be non-trivial. &nbsp;Also, this demonstrates one crude way of hacking the human brain in order to accomplish a task. &nbsp;Essentially, these postings and all of their variants are simple memetic mind viruses. &nbsp;In 4chan especially, they can be seen to outcompete actual posting when placed side by side. &nbsp;No one wants to be killed in spectacularly gruesome detail, and so they spread with ease and can dominate threads when the conditions are right. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anyone else have examples of Pascal's Mugging or memetic viruses?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null,

made</a>:</p>\n<p>Imagine a world with a single observer flipping a quantum coin many times.&nbsp;After the observer has seen a million coinflips and they look fair (incompressible), what should he believe about the next&nbsp;thousand? Modern physics says he should have a uniform probability&nbsp;distribution (Born rule). But the universal prior seems to disagree. The&nbsp;algorithmic complexity of the preceding million coinflips is already sunk, so seeing 1000 heads in a row should look more probable to the&nbsp;observer than seeing a more random sequence. Moreover, the combined weight of the first hundred eligible simple programs should exceed the combined weight of everything else in the mixture, no matter how many input bits we've already seen.&nbsp;(That last statement depends on the encoding of programs, but I think I can make it work for any encoding by tweaking the value of 100.)</p>\n<p>Of course this doesn't in any way overthrow the universality of Solomonoff induction. The Born rule is a computable prior, therefore it's found somewhere within the universal mixture, so the observer's probability assignments will never be more than a multiplicative constant away from the uniform prior. But then we should be able to detect the multiplicative constant experimentally, and it just doesn't seem to be there. As far as we know, the outcomes of real-world quantum coinflips pass all known tests for \"true\" randomness, like limiting frequencies or the law of large numbers, with no apparent bias toward algorithmic simplicity.</p>\n<p>These days it's easy to get quantum coinflips <a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/\">from the internet</a>. So you have an easy way to generate and observe a random bitstring whose probability under the Solomonoff prior is unimaginably close to zero. Maybe run some tests on it, hoping that Nature uses a pseudorandom generator in disguise after all, but I wouldn't bet on that :-)</p>\n<p>The above argument seems to dash hopes of explaining our conscious observations by a simplicity prior, like <a href=\"http://finney.org/hal/udassa/summary1.html\">UDASSA</a>. This raises the question: what sort of prior would fare better? In particular, what prior should we use for separating good physical theories from bad ones?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "cHLq8QpjY4psGJ9qt", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 2, "baseScore": 4, "extendedScore": null, "score": 1e-06, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "8333", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 1, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": true, "tableOfContents": null, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": null, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-06-29T02:24:51.724Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "Weekly Marin, CA meetup", "slug": "weekly-marin-ca-meetup", "viewCount": null, "lastCommentedAt": null, "clickCount": null, "deletedDraft": false, "status": 2, "isFuture": false, "sticky": false, "stickyPriority": 2, "userIP": null, "userAgent": null, "referrer": null, "author": null, "user": {"username": "Nevin", "createdAt": "2010-04-18T05:21:48.494Z", "isAdmin": false, "displayName": "Nevin"}, "userId": "ANxaBx9JTRYGd7Ltk", "domain": null, "pageUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Cs7eATyTjfDZ9iZMQ/weekly-marin-ca-meetup", "pageUrlRelative": "/posts/Cs7eATyTjfDZ9iZMQ/weekly-marin-ca-meetup", "linkUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Cs7eATyTjfDZ9iZMQ/weekly-marin-ca-meetup", "postedAtFormatted": "Wednesday, June 29th 2011", "emailShareUrl": "mailto:?subject=Interesting%20link%3A%20Weekly%20Marin%2C%20CA%20meetup&body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20find%20this%20interesting%3A%0A%0AWeekly%20Marin%2C%20CA%20meetup%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FCs7eATyTjfDZ9iZMQ%2Fweekly-marin-ca-meetup%0A%0A(found%20via%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com)%0A%20%20", "twitterShareUrl": "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Weekly%20Marin%2C%20CA%20meetup%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FCs7eATyTjfDZ9iZMQ%2Fweekly-marin-ca-meetup", "facebookShareUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FCs7eATyTjfDZ9iZMQ%2Fweekly-marin-ca-meetup", "socialPreviewImageUrl": "", "question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 66, "htmlBody": "<p>The Less Wrong Marin group has been happening for over a month now, and can be declared a regular meetup.

Don't just admit local errors. Don't try to protect your pride by conceding the absolute minimal patch of ground. Making small concessions means that you will make only small improvements.

There's no conflict between saying \"your past circumstances determined that you would rush into the burning orphanage\" and \"you decided to rush into the burning orphanage\"; what really matters is the experience of weighing possible options against your emotions and morals, without knowledge of what you will decide, rather than some hypothetical freedom to have done something different, etc. Basically, the experience of deciding between alternatives is real, don't worry too much about nonsense philosophical \"free will\" debates, just move on and live your life. Fine.</p>\n<p>But I'm trying to figure out the best way to conceptualize the idea that certain biological conditions can \"inhibit\" your \"free will,\" even under a reductionist understanding of the concept. Consider this recent article in <em>The Atlantic</em> called \"<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/8520/\">The Brain on Trial</a>.\" The basic argument is that we have much less control over ourselves than we think, that biology and upbringing have tremendous influences on our decisions, and that the criminal justice system needs to account for the pervasiveness of biological influence on our actions. On the one hand, <em>duh</em>. The article treats the idea that we are \"just\" our biology as some kind of big revelation that has only recently been understood:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The crux of the problem is that it no longer makes sense to ask, &ldquo;To what extent was it his <em>biology</em>, and to what extent was it <em>him</em>?,&rdquo; because we now understand that there is no meaningful distinction between a person&rsquo;s biology and his decision-making. They are inseparable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is that because we've just now discovered reductionism? If we weren't \"just\" our biology, what <em>would</em> we be? Magic? Whatever we mean by consciousness and decision-making, I'm sure LW members pretty much all accept that <a href=\"/lw/r0/thou_art_physics/\">they occur <em>within</em> physics</a>. The author doesn't even seem to fully grasp this point himself, because he states at the end that there \"may\" be at least <em>some</em> space for free will, independent of our biology, but that we just don't understand it yet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Free will <em>may</em> exist (it may simply be beyond our current science), but one thing seems clear: if free will <em>does</em> exist, it has little room in which to operate. It can at best be a small factor riding on top of vast neural networks shaped by genes and environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously most LW reductionists are going to immediately grasp that \"free will\" doesn't exist <em>in addition</em> to our neural networks. What would that even mean? It's not \"90% neural networks, 10% free will\" -- the point is that the process of your neural networks operating normally on a particular decision is what we <em>mean</em> by \"free will,\" at least when we care to use that concept. (If anyone thinks I've stated this incorrectly, feel free to correct me.)</p>\n<p>But still, notwithstanding that a lot of this article sort of seems to be missing the point (largely because the author doesn't quite get how <em>obvious</em> the central premise really is), I'm still wrestling with how to understand some of its more <em>specific</em> points, within the reductionist understanding of free will. For example, Charles Whitman, the shooter who killed 13 people from the UT Tower, had written out a suicide note noting that he had recently been the \"victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts\" and requesting that his brain be examined. An autopsy revealed that he had a large brain tumor that had damaged his amygdala, thus causing emotional and social disturbances. Similarly, in 2000, a man named \"Alex\" (fake name, but real case) suddenly developed pedophilic impulses at age 40, and was eventually convicted of child molestation. Turns out he also had a brain tumor, and once it was removed, his sexual interests went back to normal. The pedophilic impulses soon returned, and the doctors discovered the tumor had grown back -- they removed it for good, and his behavior went back to normal.</p>\n<p>Obviously people like Charles and Alex aren't \"victims of their biology\" anymore than the rest of us. Nobody's brain has some magic \"free will\" space that \"exempts\" the person from biology. But even under the reductionist conception of free will, it still seems like Charles and Alex are somehow \"less free\" than \"normal\" people. Even though everyone's decisions are, in some sense, determined by their past circumstances, there still seems to be a meaningful way in which Charles are Alex are <em>less</em> able to make decisions \"for themselves\" than those of us without brain tumors -- almost as if they had a tick which caused involuntary physical actions, but drawn out over time in patterns, rather than in single bursts. Or to put it differently, where the phrase \"your past circumstances determine who you are when you face a choice, you are still the one that decides\" holds true for most people, it seems like it <em>doesn't</em> hold true for them. At the very least, it seems like we would certainly be justified in <em>judging</em> Charles and Alex differently from people who don't suffer from brain tumors.</p>\n<p>But if we're already committed to the reductionist understanding of free will in the first place, what does this intuition that Charles and Alex are somehow \"less free\" really mean? Obviously we all have biological impulses that make us more or less inclined to make certain decisions, and that might therefore impede on some ideal conception of \"control\" over ourselves. But are these impulses qualitatively different from biological conditions that \"override\" normal decision-making? Is a brain tumor pushing on your amygdala more akin to prison bars that really do inhibit your free will in a purely physical sense, or just a more intense version of genes that give you a slight disposition toward violent behavior?</p>\n<p>My intuition is that somewhere along the line here I may be asking a \"<a href=\"/lw/og/wrong_questions/\">wrong question</a>,\" or importing some remnant of a non-biological conception of free will into my thinking. But I can't quite pin this issue down in a way that really resolves the answer in a satisfying way, so I was hoping that some of you might be able to help me reason through this appropriately.

So, if most of us are consequentialist altruists, precisely what should we be doing? SIAI are working on the Silver-Bullet project, for example, but what about the rest of us? <a href=\"/lw/5kc/altruist_support_the_plan/\">Giles is attempting to form a altruist community</a>, and I'm sure there are a number of other, scattered, projects members are working on independently. (I searched for any previous discussions, but didn't find any. If there are some I missed, please send me the links.)</p>\n<p>However, a lot of the community's mid-term plans seem to be riding on the success of the SIAI project, and although I am not qualified to judge it's probability... not having other plans in the event it fails, when most of us don't have any skills that would contribute to the Friendly AI project anyway, seems overly-hopeful. There are of course several short-term projects, the Rationalist Boot-Camps for example, but they don't currently seem to be one of the main focuses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I suppose, what I'm trying to ask without stepping on too many SIAI researchers toes, is what should non-researchers who want to help be doing in case it doesn't work, and why?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true,

writing to inquire about whether there's interest on LW in developing a bipolar support group.</p>\n<p>There's a general issue of the people at in-person support groups and designated online forums. been relatively uneducated; having little capacity for or ability for reflection; and for the discussion at such places to degenerate into platitudes. I was touched by datadataeverywhere's posting <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/3xi/intrapersonal_negotiation/\">Intrapersonal negotiation</a> and would be interested in talking with similar people about similar topics.</p>\n<p>I'm bipolar ii and have been for at least a decade but only fully became aware of my condition over the past year. I've found my varying functionality/productivity corresponding to hypomanic/depressive oscillations very confusing and have little idea of how to best ride out the waves. I am seeing a psychiatrist and have read books such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1606235427/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=1572305258&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=111MKBD7SP93BVZ5VXF6\">The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide, Second Edition: What You and Your Family Need to Know</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bipolar-Workbook-Tools-Controlling-Swings/dp/1593851626/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_c\">The Bipolar Workbook: Tools for Controlling Your Mood Swings</a>. I tried to read the Goodwin/Jamison <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manic-Depressive-Illness-Frederick-Goodwin-M-D/dp/0195039343\">Manic-Depressive Illness</a> but found it dull. I looked at Jamison's other books but though she's a very poetic author I found the accuracy and general applicability of her subjective narratives questionable.</p>\n<p>Anyway, any LWers who are

They gave me a confidence that sometimes frightens me. There are multiple manifestations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before, I had no problem whatsoever with believers of various religions (as long as they don't do bad things). I was still acting like an agnostic at that time. Now I tend to think less of them.</li>\n<li>Before, I tolerated disagreement about some subjects, like the supernatural. Now I loath any form of epistemic relativism.</li>\n<li>I now tend regard anyone who isn't Bayesian as either uneducated or moronic. Same thing about materialist reductionism, only with a slightly lower confidence. (And my inability to convince people of the validity of Occam's Razor doesn't help.)</li>\n<li>I sound more and more arrogant, and possibly full of myself.</li>\n<li>My urge to <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/386/\">rewire the brain</a> of anyone who won't listen grows stronger.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The closest semi-famous embodiment of this character trait I can think of is <a href=\"http://xahlee.org/\">Xah Lee</a>. I like much of his writing, but he can be very blunt, sometimes <a href=\"http://xahlee.org/Periodic_dosage_dir/t2/wikimorons.html\">to the point of insult</a>.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I do not <a href=\"/lw/209/highlights_and_shadows/\">endorse</a> all these changes. The problem is, while I know I should calm down, I just <strong><a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/18/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality\">can't</a> <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/19/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality\">lose</a></strong> when I'm confident truth is on my side. I'm not even sure I <em>should</em>. (Note however that I'm rather good at losing to <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Evidence\">evidence</a>.)</p>\n<p>So, what do you think?

And <a href=\"http://lesswrongforums.proboards.com/\">the Less Wrong Forum</a> was born.</p>\n<p>Currently, the forum has three boards: Gaming, Less Wrong/SIAI Related Topics, and General/Meta. The Gaming board is for <a href=\"/lw/6et/the_rpg_thread/\">RPGs</a>, <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_Diplomacy,_Game_2\">Diplomacy</a>, <a href=\"/lw/3lg/zendolike_induction_game_for_playing_online/\">Zendo</a>, or any other games rationalists might enjoy playing together. The LW/SIAI board is for discussing any of the topics we normally discuss on Less Wrong. The General/Meta board is for random topics and discussions of the LW site or the forum itself.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Looks like a supermajority of commenters don't want the LW board to exist because it would be redundant with the discussion section. I'll leave it up for a bit longer, and take it down if nobody says they support it.</p>\n<p>I encourage everyone to check out the forum and help make it a fun and useful part of the online rationalist community. Please make suggestions in the comments (or <a href=\"http://lesswrongforums.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=meta&amp;thread=3\">on the forum itself!</a>) about how it can be improved.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Due to problems with trolls, registration now requires an invite.

We all make mistakes and when we do we ought to say <a href=\"/lw/i9/the_importance_of_saying_oops/\">oops and move on</a>. I was taught this at an early age and I grew up in an environment where admitting error had no social stigma and where correcting somebody (even in public) was commended. Good times were had by all.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I eventually came into contact with the real world and I had to change my behavior. For instance, correcting somebody's pronunciation used to result in immediate&nbsp;repetition&nbsp;of the correct pronunciation followed by \"thanks\" and the discussion would continue without interruption. Or just a simple nod to acknowledge the correction. In the adult world a correction results in an annoyed look or a glare instead.</p>\n<p>So it turns out that some people, highly intelligent and intellectual people, seem to be completely unable to admit error. Even when it concerns a trivial mistake, such as getting a factoid wrong, the best response I can hope for is a grunt of acknowledgement. I'm not talking about uneducated or intellectually insecure people here.</p>\n<p><span>Okay, so a lot of adults don't appreciate being corrected. Duly noted. I could move on, but the virtues of scholarship and&nbsp;curiosity&nbsp;compel&nbsp;me to find out why. </span>Predictably Irrational (Ariely) and Influence (Cialdini)&nbsp;don't have the answers. My non-scientific experiments indicate that prefacing a statement with \"That's wrong because...\" doesn't work. It seems to make people extra defensive. Standard strategies of persuasion do work, of course. Rephrasing the correction as a question? Works. Saying \"Hmm\" and pausing before you correct? Works. Making a suggestion that indirectly points out the mistake? Yep, works. These are all standard strategies of persuasion and they can be used to work around the issue but they don't explain why it is that some people have such an aversion to being corrected in the first place.</p>\n<p>So where does the aversion come from?</p>\n<p>In a group context signaling could explain it: when you correct somebody you draw attention to a mistake and this could lead to (perceived) loss of status. I don't think this is the real cause because people seem equally annoyed when corrected in a private conversation where there is nobody to signal towards. In cases where signaling takes a dominant role (e.g. when a bunch of guys are talking and a woman joins in) you clearly see a change in behavior because the guys wish to be perceived in a specific way. So in some groups signaling effects can make it more difficult to admit error but signaling is not the underlying cause that makes people averse to&nbsp;acknowledging&nbsp;mistakes in the first place.</p>\n<p>Maybe it is an issue of ego. Is a correction seen as the role of a teacher thereby forcing the other in the student role? That would explain the aversion, but if that's the explicit thought process otherwise rational people would see it doesn't make sense and change their behavior accordingly. So there can't be an explicit (tactical) thought process underlying the behavior at all!</p>\n<p>Maybe people don't wish to admit their mistake because they prefer to keep it all ambiguous. By admitting a mistake <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-son3EJTrU&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=455\">they know I know that they know they're wrong</a> (youtube). This feels like the most plausible explanation, even though the explicit admission of the mistake does not change the state of the shared knowledge: the situation wasn't really ambiguous to start with.</p>\n<p>So then I'm forced to conclude it's some&nbsp;knee-jerk, gut level aversion to being corrected that has no underlying logic or motivation. I cannot even begin to comprehend this. Given the effort required to find and correct (cognitive) mistakes how can we feel anything but gratitude when somebody points out where we go wrong?</p>\n<p>Can somebody who has (or had) this aversion to admitting mistakes explain it in terms I can understand?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false,

Wrong\"</a>&nbsp;(link is to description of origin of phrase), to name a goal that its members strive towards. After factoring in the slightly self-deprecating or human-deprecating connotations the title's message sorta feels like \"We know it's impossible to become completely right, but we should at least aim to be less wrong\". But earlier today I realized that it could also be interpreted as an implicit comparison of social groups: \"We are less wrong than others.\".<sup>1&amp;2</sup>&nbsp;Does anyone know if there's a sizable minority of people who interpret \"Less Wrong\" to be <em>primarily</em>&nbsp;a boastful comparison of social groups? Edit: To make it clearer, I'm worried about potential negative effects via the social psychology of credibility and people maneuvering to uncharitably resolve unintended ambiguities to make contemptible caricatures of complex social groups whose perceived-members can thenceforth be disregarded. An example is how someone might be a lot more suspicious of an intellectual if that intellectual had been seen as somehow in league with those heartless Rand-worshipping Objectivists.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><sup>1&nbsp;</sup>I'm not sure if this connotation was intended but I suspect that if it was it was meant as a secondary and subtle message, and I suspect that if people were trying to sneak in secondary or subtle messages they would have been smart enough to realize that putting two negative-affect words next to each other to make a title isn't a good idea. But perhaps I underestimate the ratio of intellectualish cleverness to practical wisdom among those who named Less Wrong \"Less Wrong\".</p>\n<p><sup>2&nbsp;</sup>This kinda worried me because of all

false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 788, "htmlBody": "<p>When I found Less Wrong and started reading, when I made my first post, when I went to my first meetup&hellip;.</p>\n<p>It was a little like coming home.</p>\n<p>And mostly it wasn&rsquo;t. Mostly I felt a lot <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">more </em>out of place than I have in, say, church youth groups. It was hard to pinpoint the difference, but as far as I can tell, it comes down to this: a significant proportion of the LW posters are contrarians in some sense. And I&rsquo;m a conformist, even if I would prefer not to be, even if that&rsquo;s a part of my personality that I&rsquo;m working hard to change. I&rsquo;m much more comfortable as a follower than as a leader. I like pre-existing tradition, the reassuring structure of it. I like situations that allow me to be helpful and generous and hardworking, so that I can feel like a good person. Emotionally, I don&rsquo;t like disagreeing with others, and the last thing I have to work hard to do is <a href=\"/lw/42/tolerate_tolerance/\">tolerate others' tolerance</a>.</p>\n<p>And, as evidenced by the fact that I attend church youth groups, I don&rsquo;t have the strong allergy that many of the community seem to have against religion. This is possibly because I have easily triggered mystical experiences when, for example, I sing in a group, especially when we are singing traditional &lsquo;sacred&rsquo; music. In a previous century, I would probably have been an extremely happy nun.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/lw/b9/welcome_to_less_wrong/3zmi?context=3\">Someone</a>&nbsp;once expressed surprise that I was able to become a rationalist in spite of this neurological quirk. I&rsquo;ve asked myself this a few times. My answer is that I don&rsquo;t think I deserve the credit. If anything, I ended up on the circuitous path towards reading LessWrong because I love science, and I love science because, as a child, reading about something as <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">beautiful </em>as general relativity gave me the same kind of euphoric experience as singing about Jesus does now. My inability to actual believe in any religion comes from a time before I was making my own decisions about that kind of thing.<span style=\"color: #06082c; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>I was raised by atheist parents, not anti-theist so much as indifferent. We attended a Unitarian Universalist church for a while, which meant I was learning about Jesus and Buddha and Native American spirituality all mixed together, all the memes watered down to the point that they lost their power. I was fourteen when I really encountered Christianity, still in the mild form of the Anglican Church of Canada. I was eighteen when I first encountered the &lsquo;Jesus myth&rsquo; in its full, meme-honed-to-maximum-virulence form, and the story arc captivated me for a full six months. I still cry during every Good Friday service. But I must have missed some critical threshold, because I can&rsquo;t actually <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">believe in </em>that story. I&rsquo;m not even sure what it would mean to believe in a story. What does that <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">feel</em> like?</p>\n<p>I was raised by scientists. My father did his PhD in physical chemistry, my mother in plant biology. I grew up reading SF and pop science, and occasionally my mother or my father&rsquo;s old textbooks. I remember my mother&rsquo;s awe at the beautiful electron-microscope images in my high school textbooks, and how she sat patiently while I fumblingly talked about quantum mechanics, having read the entire tiny physics section of our high school library. My parents responded to my interest in science with pride and enthusiasm, and to my interest in religion with indulgent condescension. That was my structure, my tradition. And yes, that has <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">everything</em> to do with why I call myself an atheist. I wouldn&rsquo;t have had the willpower to disagree with my parents in the long run.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I have an awfully long way to go if I want to be <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">rational</em>, as opposed to being someone who&rsquo;s just interested in reading about math and science. Way too much of my motivation for &lsquo;having true beliefs&rsquo; breaks down to &lsquo;maybe then they&rsquo;ll like me.&rsquo; This is one of the annoying things about my personality, just as annoying as my sensitivity to religious memes and my inability to say no to <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">anyone</em>. Luckily, my personality also comes with the ability to get along with just about anyone, and in a forum of mature adults, no one is going to make fun of me because I&rsquo;m wearing tie-dye overalls. No one here has yet made fun of me for my interest in religion, even though I expect most people disagree with it.</p>\n<p>And there&rsquo;s one last conclusion I can draw, albeit from a sample size of one. Not everyone can be a contrarian rationalist. Not everyone can rebel against their parents&rsquo; religion. Not everyone can disagree with their friends and family and not feel guilty. But everyone can be rational if they are raised that way.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false,

But from a rationalist perspective, this is not why you should doubt. The doubt, rather, should exist to annihilate itself: to confirm the reason for doubting, or to show the doubt to be baseless.

so the story goes,  Nicholas Bernoulli proposed the following problem in the theory of games  of chance, after 1768 known as the St Petersburg paradox &hellip;:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Peter tosses a coin and continues to do  so until it should land heads when it comes to the ground. He agrees to  give Paul one ducat if he gets heads on the very first throw, two ducats  if he gets it on the second, four if on the third, eight if on the  fourth, and so on, so that with each additional throw the number of  ducats he must pay is doubled.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Nicholas Bernoulli &hellip; suggested that more  than five tosses of heads are morally impossible [and so ignored]. This  proposition is experimentally tested through the elicitation of  subjects&lsquo; willingness-to-pay for various truncated versions of the  Petersburg gamble that differ in the maximum payoff. &hellip; All gambles that  involved probability levels smaller than 1/16 and maximum payoffs  greater than 16 Euro elicited the same distribution of valuations. &hellip; The  payoffs were as described &hellip;. but in Euros rather than in ducats. &hellip; The  more senior students seemed to have a higher willingness-to-pay. &hellip;  Offers increase significantly with income. (<a href=\"http://d.repec.org/n?u=RePEc:crf:wpaper:10-14&amp;r=exp\">more</a>)</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t plausibly explained by risk aversion, nor by a general  neglect of possibilities with a &lt;5% chance. I suspect this is more  about analysis complexity, about limiting the number of possibilities  we&rsquo;ll consider at any one time. &nbsp;I also suspect this bodes ill for  existential risk mitigation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The title of the paper is <em>'Moral Impossibility in the Petersburg Paradox : A Literature Survey and Experimental Evidence'</em> (<a href=\"http://d.repec.org/n?u=RePEc:crf:wpaper:10-14&amp;r=exp\">PDF</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Petersburg paradox has led to much thought for three centuries. This<br />paper describes the paradox, discusses its resolutions advanced in the<br />literature while alluding to the historical context, and presents experimental<br />data. In particular, Bernoulli&rsquo;s search for the level of moral impossibility in<br />the Petersburg problem is stressed; beyond this level small probabilities are<br />considered too unlikely to be relevant for judgment and decision making. In<br />the experiment, the level of moral impossibility is elicited through variations<br />of the gamble-length in the Petersburg gamble. Bernoulli&rsquo;s conjecture that<br />people neglect small probability events is supported by a statistical power<br />analysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that people who are interested to raise the awareness of <em>risks from AI</em> need to focus more strongly on this problem. Most discussions about how likely <em>risks from AI</em> are, or how seriously they should be taken, won't lead anywhere if the underlying reason for most of the superficial disagreement  about <em>risks from AI</em> is that people discount anything under a certain threshold. There seems to be a point where things become vague enough that they get discounted completely.</p>\n<p>The problem often doesn't seem to be that people doubt the possibility of artificial general intelligence. But most people would <em>sooner  question their grasp of &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; than give five dollars to a  charity that tries to mitigate risks from AI because their calculations  claim it was &ldquo;rational&rdquo;</em> (those who have read the article by Eliezer Yudkowsky on <em>'<a href=\"/lw/5qi/pascals_mugging_penalizing_the_prior_probability/\">Pascal's Mugging</a>'</em> know that I used a statement from that post and slightly rephrased it). The disagreement all comes down to a general averseness to options that  have a low probability of being factual, even given that the stakes are  high.</p>\n<p>Nobody is so far able to beat arguments that bear resemblance to <a href=\"/lw/5qi/pascals_mugging_penalizing_the_prior_probability/\"> Pascal&rsquo;s Mugging</a>. At least not by showing that it is irrational to give  in from the perspective of a utility maximizer. One can only reject it  based on a strong gut feeling that something is wrong. And I think that is what many people are unknowingly doing when they argue against the SIAI or <em>risks from AI</em>. They are signaling that they are unable to take such risks into account. What most people mean when they doubt the reputation of people who claim  that <em>risks from AI</em> need to be taken seriously, or who say that AGI  might be far off, what those people mean is that <em>risks from AI</em> are too  vague to be taken into account at this point, that nobody knows enough  to make predictions about the topic right now.</p>\n<p>When GiveWell, a charity evaluation service, interviewed the SIAI (<a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/siai-2011-02-III.pdf\">PDF</a>), they hinted at the possibility that one could consider the SIAI to be a  sort of Pascal&rsquo;s Mugging:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>GiveWell:</strong> OK. Well that&rsquo;s where I stand &ndash; I accept a lot of the  controversial premises of your mission, but I&rsquo;m a pretty long way from  sold that you have the right team or the right approach. Now some have  argued to me that I don&rsquo;t need to be sold &ndash; that even at an  infinitesimal probability of success, your project is worthwhile. I see  that as a Pascal&rsquo;s Mugging and don&rsquo;t accept it; I wouldn&rsquo;t endorse your  project unless it passed the basic hurdles of credibility and workable  approach as well as potentially astronomically beneficial goal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This shows that lot of people do not doubt the possibility of <em>risks from AI</em> but are simply not sure if they should really concentrate their efforts on such vague possibilities.</p>\n<p>Technically, from the standpoint of maximizing expected  utility, given the absence of other existential risks, the answer might  very well be yes. But even though we believe to understand this  technical viewpoint of rationality very well in principle, it does also  lead to problems such as Pascal&rsquo;s Mugging. But it doesn&rsquo;t need a true Pascal&rsquo;s Mugging scenario to make people feel deeply uncomfortable with what Bayes&rsquo; Theorem, the expected utility formula, and Solomonoff induction seem to suggest one should do.</p>\n<p>Again, we currently have no rational way to reject arguments that are framed as  predictions of worst case scenarios that need to be taken seriously  even given a low probability of their occurrence due to the scale of  negative consequences associated with them. Many people are  nonetheless reluctant to accept this line of reasoning without further  evidence supporting the strong claims and  request for money made by organisations such as the SIAI.</p>\n<p>Here is for example what mathematician and climate activist <a href=\"http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/this-weeks-finds-week-310/#comment-4496\">John Baez</a> has to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of course, anyone associated with Less Wrong would ask if I&rsquo;m really maximizing expected utility. Couldn&rsquo;t a contribution to some place like the Singularity Institute of Artificial Intelligence, despite a lower chance of doing good, actually have a chance to do so much more good that it&rsquo;d pay to send the cash there instead?<br /><br />And I&rsquo;d have to say:<br /><br />1) Yes, there probably are such places, but it would take me a while to find the one that I trusted, and I haven&rsquo;t put in the work. When you&rsquo;re risk-averse and limited in the time you have to make decisions, you tend to put off weighing options that have a very low chance of success but a very high return if they succeed. This is sensible so I don&rsquo;t feel bad about it.<br /><br />2) Just to amplify point 1) a bit: you shouldn&rsquo;t always maximize expected utility if you only live once. Expected values &mdash; in other words, averages &mdash; are very important when you make the same small bet over and over again. When the stakes get higher and you aren&rsquo;t in a position to repeat the bet over and over, it may be wise to be risk averse.<br /><br />3) If you let me put the $100,000 into my retirement account instead of a charity, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do, and I wouldn&rsquo;t even feel guilty about it. I actually think that the increased security would free me up to do more risky but potentially very good things!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All this shows that there seems to be a fundamental problem with the formalized version of  rationality. The problem might be human nature itself, that some people  are unable to accept what they should do if they want to maximize their  expected utility. Or we are missing something else and our theories are  flawed. Either way, to solve this problem we need to research those  issues and thereby increase the confidence in the very methods used to  decide what to do about <em>risks from AI</em>, or to increase the confidence in  <em>risks from AI</em> directly, enough to make it look like a sensible option, a  concrete and discernable problem that needs to be solved.</p>\n<p>Many people perceive the whole world to be at stake, either due to  climate change, war or engineered pathogens. Telling them about  something like <em>risks from AI</em>, even though nobody seems to have any idea  about the nature of intelligence, let alone general intelligence or the  possibility of recursive self-improvement, seems like just another  problem, one that is too vague to outweigh all the other risks. Most  people feel like having a gun pointed to their heads, telling them about  superhuman monsters that might turn them into paperclips then needs  some really good arguments to outweigh the combined risk of all other  problems.</p>\n<p>(Note: I am not making claim about<em> </em>the possibility of<em> risks from AI</em> in and of itself but rather put forth some ideas about the underyling reasons for why some people seem to neglect existential risks even though they know all the arguments.)</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "R2uQdr8EJFvFRQrNE", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 14, "baseScore": 17, "extendedScore": null, "score": 7.355040480560916e-07, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "8389", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 11, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": null, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 67, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {"Posts": ["zdk5djtfFXSgfpeWi"]}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-07-02T11:49:06.869Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "\"The True Rejection Challenge\" -

When given the opportunity to help the woman, subjects in the high empathy condition were more likely to help than subjects in the low empathy condition, and the increase was specific to the problem that had been used to evoke empathy.</p>\n<p>What does this study say about altruism and selfishness?</p>\n<p>Some people think that humans are purely selfish, that we act for selfish motives alone. They will <a href=\"/lw/kx/fake_selfishness/\">re-interpret</a> any counter-example you give (\"But wouldn't you sacrifice your life to save the rest of the human species?\") as being compatible with purely selfish motives.</p>\n<p>Are they right? Do we act for selfish motives alone?</p>\n<p>Let's examine the evidence.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>We begin with a rough sketch of human motivation. We have 'ultimate' desires: things we desire for their own sake. We also have 'instrumental' desires: things we desire because we belief they will satisfy our ultimate desires.</p>\n<p>I instrumentally desire to go to the kitchen because I ultimately desire to eat a brownie and I believe brownies are in the kitchen. But if I come to believe brownies are in the dining room and not the kitchen, I will instrumentally desire to walk to the dining room instead, to fulfill my ultimate desire to eat a brownie. Or perhaps my desire to eat a brownie is also an instrumental desire, and my ultimate desire is to taste something sweet, and I instrumentally desire to eat a brownie because I believe that eating a brownie will satisfy my desire to taste something sweet.</p>\n<p>Of course, desires compete with each other. Perhaps I have an ultimate desire to taste something sweet, and thus I instrumentally desire to eat a brownie. But I also have an ultimate desire for regular sex, and I believe that eating a brownie will contribute to obesity that will lessen the chances of satisfying my desire for regular sex. In this case, the 'stronger' desire will determine my action.</p>\n<p>The full picture is more complicated than this,<sup>3</sup> but we only need a basic picture to assess the claim that we only act for selfish motives alone.</p>\n<p>We might categorize ultimate desires like this:<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/types-of-desires.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Psychological egoists think all ultimate desires are of type 2.&nbsp;Psychological hedonists are a subset of egoists who think that all ultimate desires are of type 1.&nbsp;Psychological altruists think that at least <em>some</em>&nbsp;ultimate desires are of type 4. If some ultimate desires are of type 3, but none are of type 4, then both egoism and altruism are false.</p>\n<p>Previously, I presented <a href=\"/lw/65w/not_for_the_sake_of_pleasure_alone/\">neurobiological evidence</a> that psychological hedonism is false. In short: desire and pleasure are encoded separately by the brain, and we sometimes desire things that are not aimed at producing pleasure, and in fact we sometimes desire things that do <em>not</em>&nbsp;produce pleasure when we get them.</p>\n<p>But can we also disprove the claim that we act for selfish reasons alone (psychological egoism), by showing that normal humans have desires for the well-being of others?</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a>The standard theory of altruism in psychology is the <em>empathy-altruism hypothesis</em>, which says that altruism exists in humans and is often the result of an empathic emotional response to another's distress.<sup>5</sup> Experiments have uncovered a plausible causal chain from perspective-taking to empathy to the motivation of helping behavior, and shown that this chain is probably incompatible with psychological egoism.</p>\n<p>Of course, showing that empathy causes helping behavior does not win the day for altruism over egoism. The egoist may say that, for example, empathy causes sadness and that people are motivated to help because they believe helping is the best way to alleviate their own sadness. Or perhaps people believe that helping people in some circumstances will make them feel good, or that failing to help will make them feel bad, and this is what motivates them to help.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Batson\">Daniel Batson</a> and other researchers have spent several decades running experiments that allow the empathy-altruism hypothesis to be compared to specific versions of the egoism. We can't review <em>all</em>&nbsp;those studies here,<sup>6</sup> but let's examine a few of them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Testing the Aversive-Arousal Reduction Hypothesis</h4>\n<p>One egoistic hypothesis explains helping behavior by saying that the sight of someone in distress causes an aversive reaction, and this (and not empathy) causes a desire to relieve the aversive emotion by helping the person in distress.</p>\n<p>The Dovidio experiment described above undermines the naive version of aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis, but the egoist may insist that one's distress is increased when one feels empathy, and that the increased helping that follows empathy is due to increased distress. In contrast, the altruist maintains that empathy evokes an ultimate desire to help, which leads to helping behavior.</p>\n<p>How can we test these competing hypotheses?&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Batson argues that manipulating difficulty of escape allows us to compare these&nbsp;two hypotheses experimentally. The central idea is that if a subject is motivated&nbsp;by an ultimate desire to help the target, that desire can be satisfied only by&nbsp;helping. However, if a subject is motivated by a desire to reduce his own&nbsp;distress, that desire can be satisfied either by helping or by merely escaping&nbsp;from the distress-inducing situation&mdash;for example, by leaving the room so&nbsp;that one is no longer confronted by the needy target. Assuming that subjects&nbsp;do whatever is easier and less costly, the aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis&nbsp;thus predicts that even subjects experiencing empathy will simply leave the&nbsp;needy target, provided escape is made easy enough.</p>\n<p>...To determine whether empathy is playing a role in producing helping&nbsp;behavior, he has to compare the behavior of low-empathy and high-empathy&nbsp;subjects. To determine whether ease of escape has any effect on the likelihood&nbsp;of helping behavior, he must arrange things so that leaving is significantly&nbsp;more costly for some subjects than for others. So there are four experimental&nbsp;conditions: low-empathy subjects where escape is either (1) easy or (2) hard,&nbsp;and high-empathy subjects where leaving is either (3) easy or (4) hard.<sup>7</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Batson says that in the condition with high-empathy where escape is easy (condition 3),&nbsp;the aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis predicts a low level of helping behavior, while the empathy-altruism hypothesis predicts a high level of helping behavior.</p>\n<p>Batson conducted 6 experiments to test these predictions. All 6 experiments confirmed the empathy-altruism hypothesis over the aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis. Let's consider one of them.<sup>8</sup></p>\n<p>In one experiment</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>student&nbsp;subjects were required to watch, via what they believed to be closed-circuit&nbsp;TV, as another student subject, Elaine, attempted to perform a task while&nbsp;receiving electric shocks at random intervals. Observer subjects were told&nbsp;that their task would be to form and report an impression of how Elaine&nbsp;performs under aversive conditions. Actually, what the subjects were viewing&nbsp;was a videotape. On the tape, Elaine is clearly finding the shocks very&nbsp;uncomfortable, and after her second trial at doing the task, she explains to&nbsp;Martha, the assistant overseeing the experiment, that she is unusually sensitive&nbsp;to mild electric shocks because of a childhood trauma. Martha then suggests&nbsp;that perhaps the observer subject might be willing to help Elaine by taking&nbsp;her place, and the experimenter asks whether the subject is willing to do that.&nbsp;To manipulate ease of escape, some subjects are told that if they decide not&nbsp;to take Elaine&rsquo;s place, they will be required to watch eight additional trials,&nbsp;while other subjects are told that if they decide not to take Elaine&rsquo;s place,&nbsp;they will be free to go, although Elaine will have to endure eight more trials.&nbsp;To manipulate the level of empathy that subjects feel for Elaine, subjects are&nbsp;given a copy of a personal values and interests questionnaire, allegedly filled&nbsp;out by Elaine, in order to help them form an impression of her performance.&nbsp;In the high-empathy condition, Elaine&rsquo;s values and interests are very similar&nbsp;to the subject&rsquo;s (which had been determined in a screening session several&nbsp;weeks before), while in the low-empathy condition, they are very different.<sup>9</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The results confirmed the empathy-altruism hypothesis over the aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis:<sup>10</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Batson-1981-results.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Testing the Empathy-Specific Reward Hypothesis</h4>\n<p>Another egoistic hypothesis claims that helping behavior is motivated by the expectation of a reward. But this doesn't explain Dovidio's results - that empathy increases helping behavior. Still, the egoist might maintain that helping behavior is especially rewarding when one feels empathy for the distressed person. Call this the empathy-specific reward hypothesis.</p>\n<p>This version of egoism predicts the helper will not be rewarded (by a jolt of pride, or whatever) if she is unable to relieve the target's distress, either because there's nothing she can do or because someone else helps the target before she can.</p>\n<p>The empathy-altruism hypothesis says that people are motivated by an ultimate desire that the target's distress be alleviated. The empathy-specific reward hypothesis (a version of egoism) predicts that the helper will not be rewarded if she&nbsp;is unable to <em>personally</em> relieve the target's distress.</p>\n<p>To test between the two hypotheses, Batson told<sup>11</sup> participants that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>they would likely&nbsp;have the chance to perform a simple task that would reduce the number&nbsp;of electric shocks that a peer would receive...&nbsp;Somewhat later, half of the participants learned, by chance, that they would&nbsp;not be performing the helping task after all, and thus that they could not help the&nbsp;other student. This divided the participants into two experimental conditions, 'perform' and 'not perform.' Subsequently, half of the participants in each&nbsp;condition learned that, by chance, the peer was not going to get the shocks,&nbsp;while the other half learned that, by chance, the peer would still have to get&nbsp;the shocks. This yielded two more experimental conditions, 'prior relief' and 'no prior relief'. All participants were also asked to self-report their&nbsp;level of empathy for the peer, so that high- and low-empathy participants&nbsp;could be distinguished. To assess mood change, the moods of all participants&nbsp;were measured both before and after the experimental manipulation. As we&nbsp;saw above, the version of the empathy-specific reward hypothesis that we&rsquo;re&nbsp;considering predicts that participants in the perform + no prior relief condition&nbsp;should indicate an elevated mood, since they were able to help the peer; it also&nbsp;predicts that participants in all the other conditions should not have an elevated&nbsp;mood, since for one reason or another they were unable to help, and thus&nbsp;were ineligible for the reward. The empathy&ndash;altruism hypothesis, by contrast,&nbsp;predicts an elevated mood in all three conditions in which the peer escaped&nbsp;the shocks: perform + no prior relief, perform + prior relief, and not perform&nbsp;+ prior relief. The only condition in which empathy&ndash;altruism predicts low&nbsp;mood is the one in which the peer gets the shocks: not perform + no prior&nbsp;relief.<sup>12</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, the results confirmed the empathy-altruism hypothesis over the empathy-specific reward hypothesis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>In these and many other experiments, the empathy-altruism hypothesis has been confirmed over a wide variety of naive and sophisticated versions of egoism.</p>\n<p>Batson concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In study after study, with no clear exceptions, we find results conforming to the pattern&nbsp;predicted by the empathy&ndash;altruism hypothesis, the hypothesis that empathic emotion&nbsp;evokes altruistic motivation. At present, there is no egoistic explanation for the results&nbsp;of these studies... Pending new evidence or a plausible new egoistic explanation for&nbsp;the existing evidence, the empathy&ndash;altruism hypothesis... seems&nbsp;to be true.<sup>13</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, it seems we probably do <em>not</em>&nbsp;act for the sake of selfishness alone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Notes</h4>\n<p><small><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;This technique for inducing empathy in subjects had previous been tested by Stotland (1969) and others.</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>2</sup> This article draws heavily from the more detailed review of the evidence available in Stich et al.

When given the opportunity to help the woman, subjects in the high empathy condition were more likely to help than subjects in the low empathy condition, and the increase was specific to the problem that had been used to evoke empathy.</p>\n<p>What does this study say about altruism and selfishness?</p>\n<p>Some people think that humans are purely selfish, that we act for selfish motives alone. They will <a href=\"/lw/kx/fake_selfishness/\">re-interpret</a> any counter-example you give (\"But wouldn't you sacrifice your life to save the rest of the human species?\") as being compatible with purely selfish motives.</p>\n<p>Are they right? Do we act for selfish motives alone?</p>\n<p>Let's examine the evidence.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>We begin with a rough sketch of human motivation. We have 'ultimate' desires: things we desire for their own sake. We also have 'instrumental' desires: things we desire because we belief they will satisfy our ultimate desires.</p>\n<p>I instrumentally desire to go to the kitchen because I ultimately desire to eat a brownie and I believe brownies are in the kitchen. But if I come to believe brownies are in the dining room and not the kitchen, I will instrumentally desire to walk to the dining room instead, to fulfill my ultimate desire to eat a brownie. Or perhaps my desire to eat a brownie is also an instrumental desire, and my ultimate desire is to taste something sweet, and I instrumentally desire to eat a brownie because I believe that eating a brownie will satisfy my desire to taste something sweet.</p>\n<p>Of course, desires compete with each other. Perhaps I have an ultimate desire to taste something sweet, and thus I instrumentally desire to eat a brownie. But I also have an ultimate desire for regular sex, and I believe that eating a brownie will contribute to obesity that will lessen the chances of satisfying my desire for regular sex. In this case, the 'stronger' desire will determine my action.</p>\n<p>The full picture is more complicated than this,<sup>3</sup> but we only need a basic picture to assess the claim that we only act for selfish motives alone.</p>\n<p>We might categorize ultimate desires like this:<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/types-of-desires.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Psychological egoists think all ultimate desires are of type 2.&nbsp;Psychological hedonists are a subset of egoists who think that all ultimate desires are of type 1.&nbsp;Psychological altruists think that at least <em>some</em>&nbsp;ultimate desires are of type 4. If some ultimate desires are of type 3, but none are of type 4, then both egoism and altruism are false.</p>\n<p>Previously, I presented <a href=\"/lw/65w/not_for_the_sake_of_pleasure_alone/\">neurobiological evidence</a> that psychological hedonism is false. In short: desire and pleasure are encoded separately by the brain, and we sometimes desire things that are not aimed at producing pleasure, and in fact we sometimes desire things that do <em>not</em>&nbsp;produce pleasure when we get them.</p>\n<p>But can we also disprove the claim that we act for selfish reasons alone (psychological egoism), by showing that normal humans have desires for the well-being of others?</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a>The standard theory of altruism in psychology is the <em>empathy-altruism hypothesis</em>, which says that altruism exists in humans and is often the result of an empathic emotional response to another's distress.<sup>5</sup> Experiments have uncovered a plausible causal chain from perspective-taking to empathy to the motivation of helping behavior, and shown that this chain is probably incompatible with psychological egoism.</p>\n<p>Of course, showing that empathy causes helping behavior does not win the day for altruism over egoism. The egoist may say that, for example, empathy causes sadness and that people are motivated to help because they believe helping is the best way to alleviate their own sadness. Or perhaps people believe that helping people in some circumstances will make them feel good, or that failing to help will make them feel bad, and this is what motivates them to help.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Batson\">Daniel Batson</a> and other researchers have spent several decades running experiments that allow the empathy-altruism hypothesis to be compared to specific versions of the egoism. We can't review <em>all</em>&nbsp;those studies here,<sup>6</sup> but let's examine a few of them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Testing_the_Aversive_Arousal_Reduction_Hypothesis\">Testing the Aversive-Arousal Reduction Hypothesis</h4>\n<p>One egoistic hypothesis explains helping behavior by saying that the sight of someone in distress causes an aversive reaction, and this (and not empathy) causes a desire to relieve the aversive emotion by helping the person in distress.</p>\n<p>The Dovidio experiment described above undermines the naive version of aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis, but the egoist may insist that one's distress is increased when one feels empathy, and that the increased helping that follows empathy is due to increased distress. In contrast, the altruist maintains that empathy evokes an ultimate desire to help, which leads to helping behavior.</p>\n<p>How can we test these competing hypotheses?&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Batson argues that manipulating difficulty of escape allows us to compare these&nbsp;two hypotheses experimentally. The central idea is that if a subject is motivated&nbsp;by an ultimate desire to help the target, that desire can be satisfied only by&nbsp;helping. However, if a subject is motivated by a desire to reduce his own&nbsp;distress, that desire can be satisfied either by helping or by merely escaping&nbsp;from the distress-inducing situation\u2014for example, by leaving the room so&nbsp;that one is no longer confronted by the needy target. Assuming that subjects&nbsp;do whatever is easier and less costly, the aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis&nbsp;thus predicts that even subjects experiencing empathy will simply leave the&nbsp;needy target, provided escape is made easy enough.</p>\n<p>...To determine whether empathy is playing a role in producing helping&nbsp;behavior, he has to compare the behavior of low-empathy and high-empathy&nbsp;subjects. To determine whether ease of escape has any effect on the likelihood&nbsp;of helping behavior, he must arrange things so that leaving is significantly&nbsp;more costly for some subjects than for others. So there are four experimental&nbsp;conditions: low-empathy subjects where escape is either (1) easy or (2) hard,&nbsp;and high-empathy subjects where leaving is either (3) easy or (4) hard.<sup>7</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Batson says that in the condition with high-empathy where escape is easy (condition 3),&nbsp;the aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis predicts a low level of helping behavior, while the empathy-altruism hypothesis predicts a high level of helping behavior.</p>\n<p>Batson conducted 6 experiments to test these predictions. All 6 experiments confirmed the empathy-altruism hypothesis over the aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis. Let's consider one of them.<sup>8</sup></p>\n<p>In one experiment</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>student&nbsp;subjects were required to watch, via what they believed to be closed-circuit&nbsp;TV, as another student subject, Elaine, attempted to perform a task while&nbsp;receiving electric shocks at random intervals. Observer subjects were told&nbsp;that their task would be to form and report an impression of how Elaine&nbsp;performs under aversive conditions. Actually, what the subjects were viewing&nbsp;was a videotape. On the tape, Elaine is clearly finding the shocks very&nbsp;uncomfortable, and after her second trial at doing the task, she explains to&nbsp;Martha, the assistant overseeing the experiment, that she is unusually sensitive&nbsp;to mild electric shocks because of a childhood trauma. Martha then suggests&nbsp;that perhaps the observer subject might be willing to help Elaine by taking&nbsp;her place, and the experimenter asks whether the subject is willing to do that.&nbsp;To manipulate ease of escape, some subjects are told that if they decide not&nbsp;to take Elaine\u2019s place, they will be required to watch eight additional trials,&nbsp;while other subjects are told that if they decide not to take Elaine\u2019s place,&nbsp;they will be free to go, although Elaine will have to endure eight more trials.&nbsp;To manipulate the level of empathy that subjects feel for Elaine, subjects are&nbsp;given a copy of a personal values and interests questionnaire, allegedly filled&nbsp;out by Elaine, in order to help them form an impression of her performance.&nbsp;In the high-empathy condition, Elaine\u2019s values and interests are very similar&nbsp;to the subject\u2019s (which had been determined in a screening session several&nbsp;weeks before), while in the low-empathy condition, they are very different.<sup>9</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The results confirmed the empathy-altruism hypothesis over the aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis:<sup>10</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Batson-1981-results.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Testing_the_Empathy_Specific_Reward_Hypothesis\">Testing the Empathy-Specific Reward Hypothesis</h4>\n<p>Another egoistic hypothesis claims that helping behavior is motivated by the expectation of a reward. But this doesn't explain Dovidio's results - that empathy increases helping behavior. Still, the egoist might maintain that helping behavior is especially rewarding when one feels empathy for the distressed person. Call this the empathy-specific reward hypothesis.</p>\n<p>This version of egoism predicts the helper will not be rewarded (by a jolt of pride, or whatever) if she is unable to relieve the target's distress, either because there's nothing she can do or because someone else helps the target before she can.</p>\n<p>The empathy-altruism hypothesis says that people are motivated by an ultimate desire that the target's distress be alleviated. The empathy-specific reward hypothesis (a version of egoism) predicts that the helper will not be rewarded if she&nbsp;is unable to <em>personally</em> relieve the target's distress.</p>\n<p>To test between the two hypotheses, Batson told<sup>11</sup> participants that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>they would likely&nbsp;have the chance to perform a simple task that would reduce the number&nbsp;of electric shocks that a peer would receive...&nbsp;Somewhat later, half of the participants learned, by chance, that they would&nbsp;not be performing the helping task after all, and thus that they could not help the&nbsp;other student. This divided the participants into two experimental conditions, 'perform' and 'not perform.' Subsequently, half of the participants in each&nbsp;condition learned that, by chance, the peer was not going to get the shocks,&nbsp;while the other half learned that, by chance, the peer would still have to get&nbsp;the shocks. This yielded two more experimental conditions, 'prior relief' and 'no prior relief'. All participants were also asked to self-report their&nbsp;level of empathy for the peer, so that high- and low-empathy participants&nbsp;could be distinguished. To assess mood change, the moods of all participants&nbsp;were measured both before and after the experimental manipulation. As we&nbsp;saw above, the version of the empathy-specific reward hypothesis that we\u2019re&nbsp;considering predicts that participants in the perform + no prior relief condition&nbsp;should indicate an elevated mood, since they were able to help the peer; it also&nbsp;predicts that participants in all the other conditions should not have an elevated&nbsp;mood, since for one reason or another they were unable to help, and thus&nbsp;were ineligible for the reward. The empathy\u2013altruism hypothesis, by contrast,&nbsp;predicts an elevated mood in all three conditions in which the peer escaped&nbsp;the shocks: perform + no prior relief, perform + prior relief, and not perform&nbsp;+ prior relief. The only condition in which empathy\u2013altruism predicts low&nbsp;mood is the one in which the peer gets the shocks: not perform + no prior&nbsp;relief.<sup>12</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, the results confirmed the empathy-altruism hypothesis over the empathy-specific reward hypothesis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h4>\n<p>In these and many other experiments, the empathy-altruism hypothesis has been confirmed over a wide variety of naive and sophisticated versions of egoism.</p>\n<p>Batson concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In study after study, with no clear exceptions, we find results conforming to the pattern&nbsp;predicted by the empathy\u2013altruism hypothesis, the hypothesis that empathic emotion&nbsp;evokes altruistic motivation. At present, there is no egoistic explanation for the results&nbsp;of these studies... Pending new evidence or a plausible new egoistic explanation for&nbsp;the existing evidence, the empathy\u2013altruism hypothesis... seems&nbsp;to be true.<sup>13</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, it seems we probably do <em>not</em>&nbsp;act for the sake of selfishness alone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Notes\">Notes</h4>\n<p><small><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;This technique for inducing empathy in subjects had previous been tested by Stotland (1969) and others.</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>2</sup> This article draws heavily from the more detailed review of the evidence available in Stich et al.

For example, I've been slowly experimenting with contests in the hopes that money, prestige and competition will be good motivators. I would like to do more contests, but I could really use help coming up with good test contest ideas, coming up with a good contest formats, and judging contests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Any

"question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 671, "htmlBody": "<p>At present, if one person chooses to, they can kill a few dozen to a few hundred people. As we discover new technologies, that number is, most likely, only going to go up - to the point where any given individual has the power to kill millions. (And this isn't a very distant future, either; it's entirely possible to put together a basement biology lab of sufficient quality to create smallpox for just a few thousand dollars.)<br /> <br /> If we want to avoid human extinction, I can think of two general approaches. One starts by assume that humans are generally untrustworthy, and involves trying to keep any such technology out of peoples' hands, no matter what other possible benefits such knowledge may offer. This method has a number of flaws, the most obvious being the difficulty in keeping such secrets contained, another being the classic \"who watches the watchers?\" problem.<br /> <br /> The other doesn't start with that assumption - and, instead, is to try to figure out what it takes to keep people from /wanting/ to kill large numbers of other people... a sort of \"Friendly Human Problem\". For example, we might start with a set of societies in which every individual has the power to kill any other at any moment, seeing what particular social norms allow people to at least generally get along with each other, and then encouraging those norms as the basis for when those people gain increasingly potentially-lethal knowledge.<br /> <br /> Most likely, there will be (or already are) some people who try the first approach, and some who try the second - which seems very likely to cause friction when they rub against each other.</p>\n<p>In the medium-to-long term, if we do establish viable off-Earth colonies, an important factor to consider is that once you're in Earth orbit, you're halfway to anywhere in the solar system; including to asteroids which can be nudged into Earth orbit to mine... or nudged to crash into Earth itself. Any individual who has the power to move around the solar system, such as to create a new self-sufficient colony somewhere (which, I've previously established to my own satisfaction, is the only way for humanity to survive a variety of extinction-level events), will have the power to kill billions. If sapience is to survive, we will /have/ to deal with people having lethal power undreamt of by today's worst tyrannical regimes - which would seem to make the first approach /entirely/ unviable.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once people have such lethal power, I've been able to think of two stable end-points. The obvious one is that everyone ends up dead - a rather suboptimal result. The other... is if everyone who has such power is very careful to never be the /first/ one to use force against anyone else, thus avoiding escalation. In game theory terms, this means all the remaining strategies have to be 'nice'; in political terms, this is summed up as the libertarian \"Non-Aggression Principle\".<br /> <br /> I think I need to think a bit more about some of the other lessons of game theory's Tit-for-Tat, such as the qualities of being retaliating, forgiving, and non-envious, and whether variations of the basic Tit-for-Tat, such as \"Tit for two Tats\" or \"Tit for Tat with Forgiveness\" would be better models. For example, the level of forgiveness that serves best might depend on the number of people who are still willing to initiate force compared to the number of people who try not to but occasionally make mistakes.</p>\n<p>I'm also rather suspicious that my thinking on this particular issue leads me to a political conclusion that's reasonably close to (though not precisely) my existing beliefs; I know that I don't have enough practice with true rationality to be able to figure out whether this means that I've come to a correct result from different directions, or that my thoughts are biased to come to that conclusion whatever the input. I'd appreciate any suggestions on techniques for differentiating between the two.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform":

the one we&rsquo;re concerned with is that women&rsquo;s libidos went from being considered as powerful or more so than men&rsquo;s to being essentially erased. Pre-Renaissance examples of horny ladies abound, from the Greeks onward; make your own list, but do include Chaucer. He&rsquo;s such fun. This change in attitudes appears to have been religiously motivated, and based on the idea that women are more spiritual and sacred than men, meaning less horny. Again, make your own list of contemporary leftovers of this attitude; there are plenty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>By the 18th century, it was taken as read that a woman who did experience (or at least express) sexual desire was suffering from a disorder. One important 1775 study of the subject linked the problem to &ldquo;secret pollutions&rdquo;, i.e. wanking, and (I swear I am not making this up) eating too much chocolate. I guess that&rsquo;d go a ways toward explaining this advertisement. Women were diagnosed with, treated for, and often operated upon for &ldquo;nymphomania&rdquo;, the dread condition that causes a woman to want sex. (Talk to your doctor; you may suffer from it yourself!) And yes, by &ldquo;operated upon&rdquo;, I mean clitoridectomy. And yes, that&rsquo;s fucking appalling.</blockquote>\n<p>I find this very odd. How could a major cultural lineage be wrong about something so much a part of ordinary experience?</p>\n<p>When I say wrong, I don't necessarily mean that we're right, or the ancients were right, though there's a lot of evidence that the Victorians were wrong.</p>\n<p>My favorite theory is that people's amount of desire for sex varies sufficiently that there's enough noise to make it easy to see patterns that aren't there. I leave the possibility open that there was a change (possibly dietary) which affected libido levels differently between men and women.</p>\n<p>People are sufficiently punitive about sex that there's going to be lies and misdirection to support the current theory about how people are supposed to be.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId":

before, and 32-33 after the debate. That makes me two for two, after my <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/04/efficient-economists-pledge.html\">similar &ldquo;win&rdquo;</a> over Bryan Caplan (42-10 before, 25-20 after).

He was pro, I was con. We also debated this subject here on <em>Overcoming Bias</em> from <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/06\">June</a> to <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/12\">December</a> 2008.

an unusual hobby or ideology, and there is probably an online community centered around it.&nbsp; This is especially wonderful for those of us who never quite fit in to mainstream society.</p>\n<p>But there's also a downside to this aspect of the internet, which is that the more we immerse ourselves in these small online communities, the less exposure we get to the rest of the world.&nbsp; And the less exposure we get to the rest of the world, the easier it is for us to hold onto false beliefs that the rest of the world rejects.&nbsp; (Of course, it's also easier to hold onto true beliefs that the rest of the world rejects.)</p>\n<p>For instance, suppose you believe that pasteurizing milk makes it less healthy, and we should all drink our milk raw.&nbsp; (I picked this example because it's something decidedly non-mainstream that I believe with high probability.)&nbsp; I'm fairly susceptible to social pressures, so at least for me, my belief in this proposition goes up when I'm hanging out with intelligent people who agree with me, and it goes down when I'm hanging out with intelligent people who look at me like I'm insane when I claim such a thing.&nbsp; They don't need to state evidence in either direction to influence my belief-probability, though that certainly helps.&nbsp; The important thing is that I think they're smart and therefore I trust their opinions.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, if I spend most of my time hanging out with normal, intelligent, scientifically-minded Americans, I start to question my beliefs regarding raw milk, but if I spend all my time on raw-milk-promoting websites, then my belief that raw milk is good for us is reaffirmed.</p>\n<p>We like having our beliefs affirmed; it makes us happy when other people think we are right about things.&nbsp; We'd rather seek out people who agree with us and can relate to our mindsets than seek out groups where everyone disagrees with us strongly.&nbsp; This is normal and reasonable, and it's why all of us rationalists are hanging out here on LessWrong instead of lurking in creationist forums.&nbsp; However, it does put us at risk of creating feedback loops: unusual ideas are proposed by people we respect, we affirm those ideas, others repeat those ideas, and so their prevalence and repetition causes them to be repeated more.&nbsp; Many of those who disagree are hesitant to voice their disagreements for fear of rejection.&nbsp; As a result, LessWrong perpetuates many <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/6cx/an_outside_view_on_less_wrongs_advice/\">ideas</a> that the rest of the world considers somewhat odd.&nbsp; Also, the rest of the world perpetuates many ideas that we at LessWrong consider extremely odd.</p>\n<p>I'm not saying anything new here, I know.&nbsp; Everything I've written so far has been discussed to death on LessWrong, and if I were less lazy this article would be full of links to the sequences.&nbsp; If I recall correctly, the sequences recommend countering this problem by recognizing that we have these biases, and consciously trying to correct for them.</p>\n<p>I try to do this, but I also tend to employ an additional solution to this problem.&nbsp; Because I recognize that I'm easily influenced by others' beliefs, I make sure to expose myself to a myriad of different belief systems.&nbsp; For instance, in politics, I read blogs by liberal feminist scientists as well as conservative anti-feminist traditionalists.&nbsp; Since I respect the authors of all the blogs I read, and recognize that they are intelligent people who have thought deeply about their perspectives, I can't easily dismiss either perspective outright as lies spoken by a moron.&nbsp; Since their beliefs differ so radically, I also can't just fall into the trap of believing everything I read.&nbsp; So I'm forced to really think about the ideas, and question why their proponents believe them, and consolidate them (and other thoughts I might have) into my own coherent worldview.</p>\n<p>Thus, I consider it important to be exposed to the ideas of people I disagree with.&nbsp; Meeting intelligent people who think differently than I do keeps my mind open, and reminds me that there are things about the world that I don't know yet, and keeps me from overestimating the probability that my beliefs are true.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, search engines like Google are making it more difficult for me to do so.&nbsp; About a week ago, I attended a lecture on information retrieval, and I was shocked to find out exactly how much our Google searches are customized to our own preferences.</p>\n<p>Suppose John and Mary both Google something like \"creationism\".&nbsp; Now suppose that John is an atheist who reads a lot of atheist forums, and Mary is a fundamentalist Christian who spends most of her time on Christian forums.&nbsp; John's Google results might contain a lot of links to people on his favorite atheist website talking about how much creationism sucks, and Mary's Google results might contain a lot of links to her friends' blogs talking about how God created the earth.</p>\n<p>In this example, John and Mary are both having their beliefs reaffirmed, because Google is presenting them with things they want to hear.&nbsp; They will not be exposed to opposing viewpoints, and will be much less likely to change their minds about important issues.&nbsp; In fact, their beliefs in their own viewpoints will probably grow stronger and stronger each time Google gives them back these results, and they will become less and less aware that another viewpoint exists.</p>\n<p>Of course, this might happen without Google filtering its search results.&nbsp; John might deliberately avoid reading the views of creationists, or dismiss them outright as moronic, or not ever Google anything that might lead him to their webpages, because he is convinced of his beliefs and would rather have them affirmed than contradicted.&nbsp; Since he would skip past the fundamentalist Christian blog results anyway, Google is doing him a service by ranking the stuff he cares about higher.</p>\n<p>But at least for me, this Google filtering is a bad thing.&nbsp; I want to see other webpages which present other viewpoints, instead of being led back to the same places over and over again.&nbsp; And if Google doesn't show them to me when I search for them, and I don't realize that my Google search results are being customized, I might never realize there's something I'm missing, or go to look for it.</p>\n<p>I'm probably making this sound more dire than it actually is.&nbsp; Obviously, I can try other search terms, or just ignore websites I've already been to.&nbsp; Or I can follow links on other websites and wander off into regions of the internet without the help of Google.&nbsp; But I still have a visceral reaction against search engines customizing their results to fit my individual ideological preferences, because they are perpetuating my biases without giving me any direct control over which pieces of information I receive.</p>\n<p>What do you guys think?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true,

It's got everything! Everyone and their mother is talking about it, and it seems just your type!\"</p>\n<p>Sounds familiar? Chances are, more than once such hype made you, if anything, <em>more reluctant</em>&nbsp;to approach the work in question, and if you do, you may be up for bitter disappointment; the work may not even be that bad per se, and fairly enjoyable if you just heard about it on your own, but it simply fails in your mind to live up to the massive hype that positions it as the best thing to happen to the universe since the Big Bang.</p>\n<p>I know that in such situations, my mental energy is often channeled in the opposite direction: into venting bitter disappointment, into arguing that it's not as great as everyone seems to think it is, into looking for just about <em>anything</em>&nbsp;critical anyone has to say about it, anywhere. Finding refuge in knowing that at least I'm not lonely in my dissent. Except when I apparently am.</p>\n<p>Typically, I expect any work of fiction, community, or social movement to have its share of praisers and critics. When a healthy balance of positive and negative opinions is preserved, I'm calm about it, regardless of my personal opinion on the subject. When something is universally critically panned, it sometimes sparks my curiosity. (\"Come on, it can't possibly be <em>that</em>&nbsp;bad!\" Except when it occasionally is.) But when something is unanimously liked, and criticism is next to nonexistant, and I just plain \"don't get it\"... then things get ugly.</p>\n<p>\"What in the blazes did everyone find in it? Why am I not affected by this outbreak of unanimous praise?\" I've had this feeling before about <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>&nbsp;(which by now has got its own share of skepticism and criticism), about the <em>Haruhi Suzumiya</em>&nbsp;franchise (which I now actually like, although its obsessive fandom still rubs me the wrong way); the current contenders are Twitter, Steven Moffat's grip over <em>Doctor Who,</em>&nbsp;and <em>My Little Pony.</em></p>\n<p>I suspect that in my case, the backlash is an automatic response that is a part of my \"defense mechanism\", so to speak, against hostile memes. I can usually detect not-so-subtle attempts at mind manipulation, such as loaded questions, biased presentation and dodging inconvenient subjects; this is why, for example, I don't watch TV news and feel uncomfortable when someone else does, as if I can feel it trying to invade my brain.</p>\n<p>I suspect, thus, that such an \"allergic\" reaction to hype is my attempt to balance the equation. The more universal the praise is, the less criticism there is (and the more quickly critics are shunned), the more my mind treats it as some kind of infection of the collective conscious, a malignant meme that it needs to repel. I don't, of course, seriously believe there is some kind of mind control at work, but it <em>feels</em>&nbsp;like it, and so I subconsciously try to distance myself from the event, trying to maintain integrity even in the face of apparently the entire world going mad. Hoping, perhaps, to slow down the spread, even if it might seem as hopeless as trying to survive in the middle of an ocean in a trough during a thunderstorm.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it represents a bias, perhaps it's not a big deal, and I should just learn not to let such things bother me, even when I feel like a lonely dissenter?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

title=\"The Limits of Intelligence (podcast)\" href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=how-physics-limits-intelligence-11-06-17\">Podcast by the author</a> (free).</p>\n<p>The author, Douglas Fox, argues that there may be physical limits to how intelligent a brain made of neurons can become, limits that may not be very distant from where we are now.</p>\n<p>He makes evolutionary arguments at a couple of points, suggesting that he is talking about how smart an organism could have evolved, rather than how smart we might make ourselves; he certainly isn't talking about how smart a machine we might create out of different materials.</p>\n<p>From the podcast (I don't have access to the article):</p>\n<p>Four routes to higher intelligence, which he argues won't get us very far:</p>\n<p><ol>\n<li>Increase the speed of axons. But that means making them fatter, which drives the neurons further apart, neutralising the gain.</li>\n<li>Increase brain size. That needs more energy, and before long you get something unsustainable. You get longer pathways in a larger brain, which slows them down. The neurons will make more connections, which makes them bigger, so the number of neurons scales slower than the volume of the brain. And anyway, whales and elephants have bigger brains than us but don't seem to be more intelligent, and cows have brains a hundred times the size of a mouse brain but aren't a hundred times smarter. So brain size doesn't seem to matter; at best the relationship with intelligence is unclear.</li>\n<li>Packing more neurons into the existing volume by making them smaller. You run into signal to noise problems. The ion channels involved in generating action potentials are a certain size, and you must have fewer in a smaller neuron, hence more random variation. The result is neurons spontaneously firing.</li>\n<li>Offload intelligence support. Books and the internet will remember things for you and help you tap the collective intelligence of your social network. Compare social insects doing things that they couldn't do individually. But by alleviating the necessity of intelligence this may even have reduced the evolutionary pressure to get smarter.</li>\n</ol></p>\n<p>He's described simply as an \"award-winning author\", but I don't know if he has any scientific background, and there are too many people of the same name to Google him.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

famously said,'The question is not, \"Can they reason?\" nor, \"Can they talk?\" but rather, \"Can they suffer?\" Most people get the point, but they treat <em>human</em> pain as especially worrying because they vaguely think it sort of obvious that a species' ability to suffer must be positively correlated with its intellectual capacity.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, most of us seem to assume, without question, that the capacity to feel pain is positively correlated with mental dexterity - with the ability to reason, think, reflect and so on. My purpose here is to question that assumption. I see no reason at all why there should be a positive correlation. Pain feels primal, like the ability to see colour or hear sounds. It feels like the sort of sensation you don't need intellect to experience. Feelings carry no weight in science but, at the very least, shouldn't we give the animals the benefit of the doubt?</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>I can see a Darwinian reason why there might even be be a negative correlation between intellect and susceptibility to pain. I approach this by asking what, in the Darwinian sense, pain is for. It is a warning not to repeat actions that tend to cause bodily harm. Don't stub your toe again, don't tease a snake or sit on a hornet, don't pick up embers however prettily they glow, be careful not to bite your tongue. Plants have no nervous system capable of learning not to repeat damaging actions, which is why we cut live lettuces without compunction.</p>\n<p>It is an interesting question, incidentally, why pain has to be so damned painful. Why not equip the brain with the equivalent of a little red flag, painlessly raised to warn, \"Don't do that again\"?</p>\n<p>[...] my primary question for today: <strong>would you expect a positive or a negative correlation between mental ability and ability to feel pain?</strong> Most people unthinkingly assume a positive correlation, but why?</p>\n<p>Isn't it plausible that a clever species such as our own might need less pain, precisely because we are capable of intelligently working out what is good for us, and what damaging events we should avoid? Isn't it plausible that an unintelligent species might need a massive wallop of pain, to drive home a lesson that we can learn with less powerful inducement?</p>\n<p>At very least, I conclude that we have no general reason to think that non-human animals feel pain less acutely than we do, and we should in any case give them the benefit of the doubt. Practices such as branding cattle, castration without anaesthetic, and bullfighting should be treated as morally equivalent to doing the same thing to human beings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2011/06/30/richard-dawkins-on-v.html\">boingboing.net/2011/06/30/richard-dawkins-on-v.html</a></p>\n<p>Imagine a being so vast and powerful that its theory of mind of other entities would itself be a sentient entity.

John Watson began his work thirty years before the first computer. Information processing still looked like magic; most scientists didn't realize that reductionist accounts of information processing were even possible. Neurons were still \"the thing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_y_Cajal\">that Spanish guy</a> keeps talking about\". Today we discuss the brain by analogy to computers; in Watson's day, they discussed the brain by analogy to their own most advanced technology, mechanical devices. Today we talk about looking for mental programs and subroutines; they sought its gears and levers instead. And just as today many philosophers dismiss consciousness as an epiphenomenon of information processing because computers don't seem to be conscious, so Watson dismissed all mental states as an epiphenomenon of mechanical processing because mechanical devices didn't have mental states.</p>\n<p>As science advanced, and as it picked up glimpses of cognition from the Stroop effect and early priming experiments, behaviorism became more sophisticated. Maybe its pinnacle of subtlety came with B.F. Skinner's \"radical behaviorism\" movement, which accepted inner mental life (which Skinner called \"mental behavior\") and sought to explain it.</p>\n<p>If Skinner was willing to acknowledge inner life, why do we still call his theory behaviorist? It's hard and not especially profitable to define \"behaviorism\", but if I had to try I'd say it is a methodology that doesn't consider mental phenomena useful as a <em>fundamental</em> level of explanation. So if we want to know why Wanda runs away from a wasp, saying \"because her previous encounters wasps have been negatively reinforced\" is more useful than \"because she felt scared\". <br /><br />And if Wanda herself says \"No, I ran away because I felt scared,\" we shouldn't be especially interested in her opinion: she has privileged access to a certain type of output of the process generating her behavior, but not to the process itself.<br /><br />Imagine the better behaviorists, if you like, as playing a worldwide half-century long game of <a href=\"/lw/nu/taboo_your_words/\">Rationalist Taboo</a>, in which you're no longer allowed to use words like \"want\", \"feel\", \"hope\", or \"decide\". It's overwhelmingly tempting to fake-explain psychology using non-technical non-explanations like \"Oh, she just acts that way because she has an overly emotional personality\" and so the whole school just promised themselves to root out that way of thinking.</p>\n<p>Although the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Morgenbesser#Stories_and_quotations\">witticism</a> that behaviorism scrupulously avoids anthropomorphizing humans was intended as a jab at the theory, I think it touches on something pretty important. Just as normal anthropomorphism - \"it only snows in winter because the snow prefers cold weather\", acts as a curiosity-stopper and discourages technical explanation of the behavior, so using mental language to explain the human mind equally halts the discussion without further investigation.</p>\n<p>This idea of Rationalist Taboo also explains B.F. Skinner's \"mental behavior\" loophole. When he discusses thoughts as mental behavior, he's not using them as explanations for other things - not taking the easy way out and saying \"The reason I stayed in tonight is because, after thinking about it, I decided I didn't want to go to dinner\". He's taking an <em>extra</em> burden upon himself, trying to come up with explanations for thoughts as well as actions.</p>\n<p>Behaviorism became less popular in the 1950s after clever experimental protocols allowed more direct measurement of what happens inside the mind, making its taboo on mental occurrences unnecessary and restrictive. Although the philosophical commitments involved became obsolete, the scientific findings remain as valuable as ever. They have entered into the new paradigm as \"reinforcement learning\", a process widely believed to underlie many diverse mental subsystems all the way from motor coordination to social behavior.</p>\n<p>Although reinforcement learning is almost universally known, Skinner's philosophical context for the process is not. He believed that the Darwinian evolution of organisms was just one instance of a wider principle called \"selection by consequences\", the most successful optimization process in the history of the universe. Evolution can successfully design permanent features of an organism like its skin, claws, and eyes. But it is too slow to fully optimize an organism's behavior, and too large-grained to produce complex behavior on its own. It is is especially too slow and large-grained to produce human-level behavior: citing my sources in MLA format is an important skill, and I don't want to have to wait until ten generations of my ancestors have perished for citing their sources incorrectly before I can do it right.<br /><br />So evolution <a href=\"/lw/l8/conjuring_an_evolution_to_serve_you/\">conjured up a mini-evolution to serve it</a>. Reinforcement learning is <a href=\"/lw/l2/protein_reinforcement_and_dna_consequentialism/\">evolution writ small</a>; behaviors propagate or die out based on their consequences to reinforcement in a mind, just as mutations propagate or die out based on their consequences to reproduction in an organism. In the behaviorist model, our mind is not an agent, but a flourishing ecosystem of behaviors both physical and mental, all scrabbling for supremacy and mutating into more effective versions of themselves.<br /><br />Just as evolving organisms are <a href=\"/lw/l0/adaptationexecuters_not_fitnessmaximizers/\">adaptation-executors and not fitness-maximizers</a>, so <strong>minds are behavior-executors and not utility-maximizers</strong>. This returns us to the case of the blue-minimizing robot, which executed its program without any representation of a \"goal\". Behaviorism holds out the prospect of an explanation of human behavior based on similar lines.</p>\n<p>Despite its subsumption by the cognitive paradigm, behaviorism continues to hold a special place because of its association with reinforcement learning, as well as its uses in industrial psychology, applied psychology, and various successful therapies including the famous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy\">CBT</a>. It's also one of the major inspirations for connectionism, a more modern and exciting eliminativist model which we'll return to later.<br /><br />This sequence will continue by exploring some of the basics of reinforcement learning in the behaviorist paradigm, and then get into more controversial applications of the theory to explain previously mysterious human behaviors.</p>",

"authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 1097, "htmlBody": "<p>Imagine a robot with a turret-mounted camera and laser. Each moment, it is programmed to move forward a certain distance and perform a sweep with its camera. As it sweeps, the robot continuously analyzes the average RGB value of the pixels in the camera image; if the blue component passes a certain threshold, the robot stops, fires its laser at the part of the world corresponding to the blue area in the camera image, and then continues on its way.<br /><br />Watching the robot's behavior, we would conclude that this is a robot that destroys blue objects. Maybe it is a surgical robot that destroys cancer cells marked by a blue dye; maybe it was built by the Department of Homeland Security to fight a group of terrorists who wear blue uniforms. Whatever. The point is that we would analyze this robot in terms of its goals, and in those terms we would be tempted to call this robot a blue-minimizer: a machine that exists solely to reduce the amount of blue objects in the world.<br /><br />Suppose the robot had human level intelligence in some side module, but no access to its own source code; that it could learn about itself only through observing its own actions. The robot might come to the same conclusions we did: that it is a blue-minimizer, set upon a holy quest to rid the world of the scourge of blue objects.<br /><br />But now stick the robot in a room with a hologram projector. The hologram projector (which is itself gray) projects a hologram of a blue object five meters in front of it. The robot's camera detects the projector, but its RGB value is harmless and the robot does not fire. Then the robot's camera detects the blue hologram and zaps it. We arrange for the robot to enter this room several times, and each time it ignores the projector and zaps the hologram, without effect.<br /><br />Here the robot is failing at its goal of being a blue-minimizer. The <em>right</em> way to reduce the amount of blue in the universe is to destroy the projector; instead its beams flit harmlessly through the hologram.<br /><br />Again, give the robot human level intelligence. Teach it exactly what a hologram projector is and how it works. Now what happens? Exactly the same thing - the robot executes its code, which says to scan the room until its camera registers blue, then shoot its laser.<br /><br />In fact, there are many ways to subvert this robot. What if we put a lens over its camera which inverts the image, so that white appears as black, red as green, blue as yellow, and so on? The robot will not shoot us with its laser to prevent such a violation (unless we happen to be wearing blue clothes when we approach) - its entire program was detailed in the first paragraph, and there's nothing about resisting lens alterations. Nor will the robot correct itself and shoot only at objects that appear yellow - its entire program was detailed in the first paragraph, and there's nothing about correcting its program for new lenses. The robot will continue to zap objects that register a blue RGB value; but now it'll be shooting at anything that is yellow.<br /><br />The human-level intelligence version of the robot will notice its vision has been inverted. It will know it is shooting yellow objects. It will know it is failing at its original goal of blue-minimization. And maybe if it had previously decided it was on a holy quest to rid the world of blue, it will be deeply horrified and ashamed of its actions. It will wonder why it has suddenly started to deviate from this quest, and why it just can't work up the will to destroy blue objects anymore.<br /><br />The robot goes to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality\">Quirinus Quirrell</a>, who explains that robots don't really care about minimizing the color blue. They only care about status and power, and pretend to care about minimizing blue in order to impress potential allies.<br /><br />The robot goes to <a href=\"/lw/15c/would_your_real_preferences_please_stand_up/110l\">Robin</a> <a href=\"/lw/15c/would_your_real_preferences_please_stand_up/110k\">Hanson</a>, who explains that there are really multiple agents within the robot. One of them wants to minimize the color blue, the other wants to minimize the color yellow. Maybe the two of them can make peace, and agree to minimize yellow one day and blue the next?<br /><br />The robot goes to <a href=\"/lw/2p5/humans_are_not_automatically_strategic/\">Anna Salamon</a>, who explains that robots are not automatically strategic, and that if it wants to achieve its goal it will have to learn special techniques to keep focus on it.<br /><br />I think all of these explanations hold part of the puzzle, but that the most fundamental explanation is that the mistake began as soon as we started calling it a \"blue-minimizing robot\". This is not because its utility function doesn't exactly correspond to blue-minimization: even if we try to assign it a ponderous function like \"minimize the color represented as blue within your current visual system, except in the case of holograms\" it will be a case of overfitting a curve. The robot is not maximizing or minimizing anything. It does exactly what it says in its program: find something that appears blue and shoot it with a laser. If its human handlers (or itself) want to interpret that as goal directed behavior, well, that's their problem.<br /><br />It may be that the robot was created to achieve a specific goal. It may be that the Department of Homeland Security programmed it to attack blue-uniformed terrorists who had no access to hologram projectors or inversion lenses. But to assign the goal of \"blue minimization\" to the robot is a confusion of levels: this was a goal of the Department of Homeland Security, which became a <a href=\"/lw/le/lost_purposes/\">lost purpose</a> as soon as it was represented in the form of code.<br /><br />The robot is a behavior-executor, not a utility-maximizer.<br /><br />In the rest of this sequence, I want to expand upon this idea. I'll start by discussing some of the foundations of behaviorism, one of the earliest theories to treat people as behavior-executors. I'll go into some of the implications for the \"easy problem\" of consciousness and philosophy of mind. I'll very briefly discuss the philosophical debate around eliminativism and a few eliminativist schools. Then I'll go into why we feel like we have goals and preferences and what to do about them.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null,

The current hypothesis I'm exploring is that g measures the ability to take in information non-inductively this includes gossip, culture and taught skills.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>If g is a real phenomenon then it has to be explained in some form. What is it that some people possess that enables them to do better in a vast range of activities than other people? It seems likely that it is ability to absorb information from the world in some sense.</p>\n<p>When I was studying machine learning I was exhorted to put all the information about a problem domain in the learning algorithm, to make it learn efficiently. Now it was supposed to be learning about the world, so it seemed backwards that I needed to tell it about the problem to make it work. And each problem would need different information. So from this view there shouldn't be one factor that makes a system efficient over large numbers of problems. There is however one regularity about information in the world that could be exploited to help solve other problems, there is lots of information generated by humans stored in standard formats. So if this skill increased, you would expect it to have knock on effects in solving lots of other problems.</p>\n<p>I'm avoiding calling it social or linguistic information, as that seems to have connotations of solving social and linguistic problems, where as this type of information can help in solving pattern recognition problems. For example learning the concept of a triangle, that it's triangle-ness is invariant to rotation, scaling etc, can help in IQ tests where changes are made to pictures of triangles and you have to spot the commonalities. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is a sea of useful information out there in linguistic form. Maths and languages are taught&nbsp;linguistically, we memorise times tables and the letters of the alphabet. Even rationality as practised by lesswrong is counted in this class. What happens if you aren't very good at absorbing this vast wealth for some reason? It would be reasonable to expect that you would be less competent in general than your fellow man. Being able to \"understand\" concepts or formula is closely associated with the lay meaning of intelligence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So what can we predict about <em>g</em> if this view is correct?</p>\n<p>Taking in non-statistical social information is a multi-stage process. You have to do things like parse the sentence or symbols, examine it against your other beliefs for consistency, follow the logical conclusions of the belief and update it and store it so that it can be used in this process for other beliefs. And probably many other steps that I cannot guess at. Any of these might break slightly reducing the efficacy of the whole process. &nbsp;Only the first step I mentioned is unique to human intelligence, the other steps occur if you infer a belief and want to check it against your other knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So many genes for <em>g</em> might be present and can break, and are probably present in other mammals.</p>\n<p>Looking at the genetics of the <em>g</em>, it seems that it is highly heritable in some circumstances and that multiple different genes do have an effect on it[1]. Which is consistent with this hypothesis. We haven't narrowed down the locus' according to that article, I'll try and find something more recent in a while. The review article by Dreary referenced above has a slightly less specific hypothesis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Bouchard (1997) has proposed that we inherit&nbsp;not intellectual capacity as such; rather, species-typical&nbsp;affective-motivational systems shaped by the environment&nbsp;of evolutionary adaptation that drive both capacity and&nbsp;preferences. Following Hayes (1962), he suggested that&nbsp;manifest intelligence is the demonstration of skills and&nbsp;knowledge accumulated during the experiences created by&nbsp;these affective-motivational systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It goes on to mention that the <a title=\"Flynn Effect\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect\">Flynn effect</a> is consistent with this, that society can accumulate better knowledge which then gets passed onto humans which show.</p>\n<p>I'm going to do some more reading of references and will update this post as time allows, but I would be interested to know of alternate explanations. Then perhaps we can see which position of the debate the best explanation supports.</p>\n<p>Edited to try and clear up confusions - 5th July</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a name=\"Genetic

and to the idea that natural or scientific facts are all the facts there are. The aim of this post is just to try to make clear why this should be so, and hopefully to get feedback on what people think of the tension.</p>\n<h4>In short</h4>\n<p>To a first approximation, a belief is rational just in case you ought to hold it; an action rational just in case you ought to take it. A person is rational to the extent that she believes and does what she ought to. Being rational, it is fair to say, is a normative or prescriptive property, as opposed to a merely descriptive one. Natural science, on the other hand, is concerned merely with descriptive properties of things -what they weigh, how they are composed, how they move, and so on. On the face of it, being rational is not the sort of property about which we can theorize scientifically (that is, in the vocabulary of the natural sciences). To put the point another way, rationality concerns what a thing (agent) ought to do, natural science concerns only what it is and will do, and one cannot deduce 'ought' from 'is'.</p>\n<h4><strong>At greater length</strong></h4>\n<p>There are at least two is/ought problems, or maybe two ways of thinking about the is/ought problem. The first problem (or way of thinking about the one problem) is posed from a subjective point of view. I am aware that things <em>are</em> a certain way, and that I am <em>disposed</em> to take some course of action, but neither of these things implies that I ought to take any course of action -neither, that is, implies that taking a given course of action would in any sense be right. How do I justify the thought that any given action is the one I ought to take? Or, taking the thought one step further, how, attending only to my own thoughts, do I differentiate merely being inclined to do something from being bound by some kind of rule or principle or norm, to do something?<br /><br />This is an interesting question -one which gets to the very core of the concept of being justified, and hence of being rational (rational beliefs being justified beliefs). But it isn't the problem of interest here.<br /><br />The second problem, the problem of interest, is evident from a purely objective, scientific point of view. Consider a lowly rock. By empirical investigation, we can learn its mass, its density, its mineralogical composition, and any number of other properties. Now, left to their own devices, rocks don't do much of anything, comparatively speaking, so it isn't surprising that we don't expect there to be anything it <em>ought</em> to do. In any case, natural science does not imply there is anything it ought to do, I think most will agree.<br /><br />Consider then a virus particle - a complex of RNA and ancillary molecules. Natural science can tell us how it wiil behave in various circumstances -whether and how it will replicate itself, and so on- but once again surely there is nothing in biochemistry, genetics or other science which implies there is anything our very particle ought to do. It's true that we may think of it as having the goal to replicate itself, and consider it to have made a mistake if it replicates itself inaccurately, but these conceptions do not issue from science. Any sense in which it ought to do something, or is wrong or mistaken in acting in a given way, is surely purely metaphorical (no?).<br /><br />How about a bacterium? It's orders of magnitude more complicated, but I don't see that matters are any different as regards what it ought to do. Science has nothing to tell us about what if anything is important to a bacterium, as distinct from what it will tend to do.<br /><br />Moving up the evolutionary ladder, does the introduction of nervous systems make any difference? What do we think about, say, nematodes or even horseshoe crabs? The feedback mechanisms underlying the self-regulatory processes in such animals may be leaps and bounds more sophisticated than in their non-neural forebears, but it's far from clear how such increasing complexity could introduce goals.<br /><br />To cut to the chase, how can matters be any different with the members of <em>Homo sapiens</em> ? Looked at from a properly scientific point of view, is there any scope for the attribution of purposes or goals or the appraisal of our behaviour in any sense as right or wrong? I submit that a mere increase in complexity -even if by many orders of magnitude- does not turn the trick. To be clear, I'm not claiming there are no such facts -far from it- just that these facts cannot be articulated in the language of purely natural science.<br /><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<h4>The upshot</h4>\n<p>The foregoing thoughts are hardly original. David Hume is famous for having observed that <em>ought</em> cannot be derived from <em>is</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surpriz'd to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, <em>is</em>, and <em>is not</em>, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an <em>ought</em>, or an <em>ought not</em>. This change is imperceptible; but is however, of the last consequence. For as this <em>ought</em>, or <em>ought not</em>, expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessary that it shou'd be observ'd and explain'd; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention wou'd subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relation of objects, nor is perceiv'd by reason. -David Hume, <em>A Treatise of Human Nature </em>(London: Penguin, 1984) p. 521.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(the issue, together with this quote are touched on with a different point of view in this <a title=\"post\" href=\"/lw/5u2/pluralistic_moral_reductionism/\">post</a> of <a href=\"/user/lukeprog\">lukeprog</a>'s). I think they need facing up to. I see three options:<br /><br />Option (1): Accept the basic point, stick resolutely to naturalism, and deny that there are any facts as to what it is rational for any given member of <em>Homo sapiens</em> to do. In other words, become an eliminativist about all normative concepts. Paul Churchland, I understand, is an example of an exponent of this position (or something more nuanced along these lines).<br /><br />Option (2): Reject the argument above on one or another ground. Try somehow to shoehorn normative facts into a naturalistic world-view, at the possible peril of the coherence of that world-view. I acknowledge that this can be a valiant undertaking for those whose commitments suggest it. Any who embark on it should be aware that there is at least a half a century's worth of beleaguered efforts to put this Humpty together -it is not an easy task. One might want to start with the likes of Ruth Garrett Millikan or Jerry Fodor, then their various critics.<br /><br />Option (3): Accept the argument above and reconcile yourself to the existence of mutually incommensurable but indispensable understandings of yourself. Be happy.</p>\n<h4><strong>One response</strong></h4>\n<p>This is already ponderously long, but there is one response worth anticipating, namely, that <em>oughts</em> can be inferred from wants (or preferences or utility functions), and that wants (preferences, utility functions) are naturalistic. The problem here is with the second conjunct - wants (etc.) are <em>not</em> naturalistic. At least, not obviously so (and, incidentally, the same fate befalls beliefs). My explanation is as follows.<br /><br />An example of the thinking behind this proposal presumably would be something like,<br /><br />P) X's wanting that X eats an apple entails, other things being equal, that X ought to eat an apple.<br /><br />The force of naturalism or physicalism in this context is presumably a commitment to some empirically testable analysis concerning wants comparable to \"Water is H2O\", e.g.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to want that one eats an apple = to be in brain state ABC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>or</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to want that one eats an apple = to be composed in part of a some structure (brain or other) which implements a Turing machine which is in computational state DEF</li>\n</ul>\n<p>or ...<br /><br />Now, if both of these thoughts (the thought about wants entailing <em>oughts</em> and the thought about there being an empirically testable analysis) are correct, then it should be possible to substitute the analysis into (P):<br /><br />P') That X's brain is in state ABC entails, other things being equal, that X ought to eat an apple.<br /><br />or<br /><br />P'') That X is composed in part of some structure which implements a Turing machine which is in computational state DEF entails, other things being equal, that X ought to eat an apple.<br /><br />or... (your favourite theory here)<br /><br />I submit that neither P' nor P'' is at all plausible, for the reasons reviewed above. A thing's merely being in a certain physical or computational state does not imbue it with purpose. Such facts do not entail that there is anything which matters to it, or which makes anything right or wrong for the thing. Concerning P'', note that although computers are sometimes thought of as having purposes in virtue of our having designed them (the computer 'makes a mistake' when it calculates an incorrect value), there is not normally thought to be any sense in which they have intrinsic purposes independent of ours, as the view under scrutiny would require of them.<br /><br />There are all kinds of possible refinements of P' and P'' (P' and P'' are commonly viewed as non-starters anyway, owing to the plausibility of so-called semantic externalism which they ignore). My question is whether any more refined option shows a way to defeat the objection being raised here.<br /><br />Wants do indeed imply <em>oughts</em>. Since there plausibly is no physical or computational state being in which implies there is anything one ought to do, wanting is not identical to being in a physical or computational state.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "CEadNPuQGRscmJdPp", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallDownvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 14, "baseScore": 2, "extendedScore": null, "score": 6e-06, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "8404", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 2, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": {"html": "<p>On the face of it, there is a tension in adhering both to the idea that there are facts about what it's rational for people to do and to the idea that natural or scientific facts are all the facts there are.

The first concerned the 'photoelectric effect': how did ultraviolet light knock electrons off the surface of a piece of metal? The second concerned 'Brownian motion': why did pollen particles suspended in water move about in a random zigzag pattern? The third concerned the 'luminiferous ether' that was supposed to fill all of space and serve as the medium through which light waves moved, the way sound waves move through air, or ocean waves through water: why had experiments failed to detect the earth&rsquo;s motion through this ether? Each of these problems had the potential to reveal what Einstein held to be the underlying simplicity of nature. Working alone, apart from the scientific community, the unknown junior clerk rapidly managed to dispatch all three. His solutions were presented in four papers, written in the months of March, April, May, and June of 1905.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A few years earlier, David Hilbert had published <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems\">23 open problems</a> in mathematics, about half of which were solved during the 20th century.</p>\n<p>More recently, Timothy Gowers has used his blog to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers#Polymath_Project\">promote</a> open problems in mathematics that might be solved collaboratively, online. After just seven weeks, the first problem was \"<a href=\"http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/03/10/problem-solved-probably/\">probably solved</a>,\" resulting in <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.3956\">some</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0374\">published</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3926\">papers</a> under the pseudonym 'D.H.J. Polymath.'</p>\n<p>The Clay Mathematics Institute offers a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems\">$1 million prize</a> for the solution to any of 7 particularly difficult problems in mathematics. One of these problems has now been solved.</p>\n<p>In 2006, researchers&nbsp;defined <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/journals/ARTL/Bedau.pdf\">14 open problems in artificial life</a>, and their paper continues to <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9774043633427277067&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en\">guide research</a> in that field.</p>\n<p>And of course <a href=\"http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~hochberg/undopen/\">there</a> <a href=\"http://garden.irmacs.sfu.ca/\">are</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems\">many</a> <a href=\"http://maven.smith.edu/~orourke/TOPP/\">more</a> <a href=\"http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/open/\">open</a> <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090110010052/http://apperceptual.wordpress.com/2007/12/18/open-problems/\">problems</a>. <a href=\"http://www.combinatorics.net/problems/\">Many</a> <a href=\"http://www.openproblems.net/\">more</a>.</p>\n<p>\n<p>One problem with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence\">Friendly AI research</a>&nbsp;is that even those who&nbsp;<em style=\"font-style: italic;\">could</em>&nbsp;work on the project often don't have a clear picture of what the open problems are and how they interact with each other. There are a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/upload/TDT-v01o.pdf\">few</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/upload/artificial-intelligence-risk.pdf\">papers</a>&nbsp;that introduce readers to the problem space, but more work could be done to (1) define each open problem with some precision, (2) discuss how each open problem interacts with other open problems, (3) point readers to existing research on the problem, and (4) suggest directions for future research. Such an effort might even clarify the problem space for those who&nbsp;<em style=\"font-style: italic;\">think</em>&nbsp;they understand it.</p>\n<p>(This is, in fact, where&nbsp;<a

terms</a>]. Here's <a href=\"http://librivox.org/the-art-of-controversy-or-the-art-of-being-right-by-arthur-schopenhauer/\">an audiobook</a>.</p>\n<p>EDIT: In this article I adopt a bit of a Devil's Advocate attitude. I'm not entirely convinced of what I'm suggesting, but I'll try to give it my all to make it look at least worth considering. I might <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood\">get carried away</a> at some points and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGJbYpeDMZg&amp;feature=related\">overtly relish the villainy like a mad Britannian prince</a>, which is unsightly, and, more importantly, unwarranted, so please forgive that. I'll leave those elements in, so that this is a Self Demonstrating Article.</p>\n<p>So, the rationale is as follows: sometimes you get in an argument with someone. You're not quite sure you're right. You're not quite sure he's right. Even if you play fair, there's no guarantee it's the truth that'll come out. A few hours later, you could think up of an argument that would have saved your cause, you just failed to think of it during the discussion itself. And usually it's not just a matter of finding the truth. <br /><br />First, it's a matter of \"being right\". If you want to clash intellects, there's no more violent, crude, intimate way than this. When you're proven wrong in a discussion, especially in public and in a way that makes you look like an idiot, your ego could get hit hard. Not to mention your status. Back when this book was written, people killed themselves, and each other, over this stuff.<br /><br />Second, beside your own pride and life, there might be stuff bigger than yourself riding on this. You just can't afford to stick to the truth, or to give up just because the other side has better arguments. You gotta win, in the eyes of the public, no matter what.<br /><br />This book makes a fairly good job of singling out different tricks to bullshit your way into winning an argument. Or at least stall for time and take your opponent off-balance and distract them while you think of something legitimate to say. Let's review a non-comprehensive list of the tricks he proposes (the cartoon site and the full text are much more adequate, having one or many examples per case and being very eloquently phrased by the writer himself.</p>\n<p>Let's classify them by blocks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attacks to the opponent's morale:<ol>\n<li>being an openly unfair and insolent prick just to piss them off.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>claiming vicotry in an authoritative, assertive voice, despite the argument going against you</li>\n<li>interruptions and diversions, derailing</li>\n<li>if they're angry about some particular argument, rub it against their faces until they lose it: it's probably a weak point in their defense. Same thing if they are being evasive.</li>\n<li>invoking arguments that use obscure sources and are hard to check</li>\n<li>appeal to consequences: show them that defending their argument means going against their own interests in a way they didn't think of. They'll drop it like a hot potato.</li>\n<li>confuse the hell out of your opponent through nonsensical pompous speech that sounds authoritative</li>\n<li>personal attacks and insults</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Strawmanning (making the opponent say something they didn't actually say, amking their position look worse than it actually is): then attacking the strawman. Also, making your position look better than it is.<br /><ol>\n<li>By overgeneralization and slippery slopes</li>\n<li>Exploiting double meanings, homonyms, unclear definitions</li>\n<li>Using loaded words, buzzwords, and guilt by association.</li>\n<li>Using false dichotomies (\"with us or against us\") and other false syllogisms to extract outrageous things from your opponent's proposition that weren't even there in the first place</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Checkmate: the cleaner sort of tactic, and the most humiliating, they rely on making the opponent sabotage themselves. The favored type of method of the <a href=\"/lw/5ug/ace_attorney_pioneer_rationalismdidactic_game/\">Ace Attorney</a> games as well as the more heroic court drama.<br /><ol>\n<li>Getting the opponent to admit to your premises (or even the premises of your premises) one after the other, without letting them know that they lead to your conclusion all along. Then draw it. It's safer to draw it yourself, but it's more fun to make *them* draw it and then watch their expressions as the absolute horror of what they've just done dawns on them. Mwa ha ha. One way of doing this is by using questions, Socrates-style, possibly in disorder so they stay off-balance. An especially fun way to do this is getting them to say no to propositions you fake needing him to agree on, then submitting the antithesis of what they just negated, which they'll have no choice but to admit.</li>\n<li>Using <em>one</em> counterexample to blow up an entire generalization, which crumbles like a house of cards. Especially effective if the counterexample is a Black Swan your opponent isn't familiar with.</li>\n<li>Using their very arguments against their thesis, mostly by pointing out implications they missed. Especially fun if the argument is false in the first place, but is part of the core dogma of whatever cult, party, or group the opponent pledges allegiance to.</li>\n<li>Angering the opponent into strawmanning their own position through exaggeration by way of exasperated reaction to your incessant bugging. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hGvQtumNAY\">\"YOU CAN'T <strong>HANDLE</strong> THE TRUTH\"</a>)</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Jumping to conclusions:<ol>\n<li>Making the opponent admit to the premises, then making the conclusion yourself, sometimes by generalizing his admissions to specific cases as admissions to a general truth</li>\n<li>Begging the question</li>\n<li>Using a faulty proof to reject the wole proposition</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Just plain make do with bullshit:<ol>\n<li>Your opponent uses a sophistic nonsense argument. Instead of taking the time of exposing it for what it is, you just counter it with bullshit of your own</li>\n<li>Appeal to authority rather than reason.</li>\n<li>\"It applies in theory, but not in practice\". If the theory does not apply, it means it is wrong, period.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Escapes and getaways, sometimes of the cowardly sort:<ol>\n<li>Petitio Principi: refusing to admit an argument that would immediately lead to the opponent's desired conclusion by exploiting the fact that your opponent and audience didn't notice that little step and confused the premise with the conclusion and claiming it begs the question. One of the more subtle of the bunch.</li>\n<li>Defense by subtle distinction: if your opponent has blasted part of your proposition, claim to have been misunderstood, and squeeze and narrow the original proposition down to something your opponent didn't get to disprove. Save face, salvage what you can.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm just surprised Schopenhauer isn't an Internet idol by this point. I'm also pleasantly surprised at how our discussions avert most of this stuff, most of the time. Then again, our motivations are different from the usual, are they not? But what about our relation to the general public? Suppose one of us accepted an invitation at O'Reilly's? What about convincing people to donate when there just isn't time to convince them of how important our cause is or how we are the right people to carry it out (not to mention we're not quite consensual or certain on either ourselves)?</p>\n<p>Spartans were famed for their laconic way of communicating. In fact, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laconic_phrase\">the term was named after them</a>. It was an actual course in their education: teachers would mock them and provoke them, and the kids would be punished harshly unless they could respond quickly, forcefully and wittily. I think we should train ourselves on this. There is a time and a place for careful deconstruction of the opponent's arguments, and careful weighting of what is right and wrong. There's another for trusting in the heuristics you're following and acting on them <em>now</em>. Sometimes you just have to win, and worry about the truth later. So we should learn to identify when exactly the gloves should come off, and learn how to take them off quickly, so that we are never taken off-guard. If the very existence of humanity is riding on this project, I think a little verbal swashbuckling is the *least* we can allow ourselves in terms of consequentially moral leeway.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/lw/i5/bayesian_judo/\">Not that just sticking to the truth is entirely ineffective</a>, but opponents aren't always as malleable as the one in that example, we're not all as smart and witty as Eliezer, and sometimes the <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance\">inferential distances</a> are just too huge not to resort to <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanBrowned\">Dan Browned</a>, <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue\">Conviction By Counterfactual Clue</a>, or <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesToChildren\">Lies To Children</a> for the sake of expediency (<a href=\"http://logicien.fr/28-persuade-the-audience-not-the-opponent.html\">there's an entire rule in Schopenhauer's book dedicated to the case of debating of technical matters before an untrained public</a>, and <em>he</em> provides a <em>really </em>good example, to boot).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This article suggests that learning about, and perhaps embracing the dark arts may be a useful if not outright necessary necessary means to achieve our goals.<strong> The author, on the other hand, isn't so sure. However, at the very least, I think we should <em>know about</em> this stuff, if only in a Defense <em>Against</em> The Dark Arts way, and make and study a list of similar, more contemporary works that would give us a better results-to-time-investment ratio in learning these tricks and others, and, more importantly, their counters.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BTW, Robert Greene's books, despite being rather unscientific, are very promising in that regard. Their advice is fairly useless if you want to apply it, but once you've gone through all the contents (and there's a lot of stories there) you'll be on guard against practically anything: it's really hard to beat the Epic Fails he lists there, which are all the more epic because usually they involve smart, perceptive, strong, powerful people, and they all still fall for the exact same tricks, over and over again. If only because they are fascinating narrative anthologies, and a very fun intellectual read, and we are very much in favor of fun and intellectualism, right?</p>\n<p>Also, for those that have followed this article from the start, notice how the successive rewrites make it a self-demonstration of the \"defense by subtle distinction\" rule.

"question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 1123, "htmlBody": "<p>Behaviorism historically began with Pavlov's studies into classical conditioning. When dogs see food they naturally salivate. When Pavlov rang a bell before giving the dogs food, the dogs learned to associate the bell with the food and salivate even after they merely heard the bell . When Pavlov rang the bell a few times without providing food, the dogs stopped salivating, but when he added the food again it only took a single trial before the dogs \"remembered\" their previously conditioned salivation response<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>So much for classical conditioning. The real excitement starts at operant conditioning. Classical conditioning can only activate reflexive actions like salivation or sexual arousal; operant conditioning can produce entirely new behaviors and is most associated with the idea of \"reinforcement learning\".<br /><br />Serious research into operant conditioning began with B.F. Skinner's work on pigeons. Stick a pigeon in a box with a lever and some associated machinery (a \"Skinner box\"<sup>2</sup>). The pigeon wanders around, does various things, and eventually hits the lever. Delicious sugar water squirts out. The pigeon continues wandering about and eventually hits the lever again. Another squirt of delicious sugar water. Eventually it percolates into its tiny pigeon brain that maybe pushing this lever makes sugar water squirt out. It starts pushing the lever more and more, each push continuing to convince it that yes, this is a good idea.<br /><br />Consider a second, less lucky pigeon. It, too, wanders about in a box and eventually finds a lever. It pushes the lever and gets an electric shock. Eh, maybe it was a fluke. It pushes the lever again and gets another electric shock. It starts thinking \"Maybe I should stop pressing that lever.\" The pigeon continues wandering about the box doing anything and everything other than pushing the shock lever.<br /><br />The basic concept of operant conditioning is that an animal will repeat behaviors that give it reward, but avoid behaviors that give it punishment<sup>3</sup>.<br /><br />Skinner distinguished between primary reinforcers and secondary reinforcers. A primary reinforcer is hard-coded: for example, food and sex are hard-coded rewards, pain and loud noises are hard-coded punishments. A primary reinforcer can be linked to a secondary reinforcer by classical conditioning. For example, if a clicker is clicked just before giving a dog a treat, the clicker itself will eventually become a way to reward the dog (as long as you don't use the unpaired clicker long enough for the conditioning to suffer extinction!)<br /><br />Probably Skinner's most famous work on operant conditioning was his study of reinforcement schedules: that is, if pushing the lever only gives you reward some of the time, how obsessed will you become with pushing the lever?<br /><br />Consider two basic types of reward: interval, in which pushing the lever gives a reward only once every t seconds - and ratio, in which pushing the lever gives a reward only once every x pushes.<br /><br />Put a pigeon in a box with a lever programmed to only give rewards once an hour, and the pigeon will wise up pretty quickly. It may not have a perfect biological clock, but after somewhere around an hour, it will start pressing until it gets the reward and then give up for another hour or so. If it doesn't get its reward after an hour, the behavior will go extinct pretty quickly; it realizes the deal is off.<br /><br />Put a pigeon in a box with a lever programmed to give one reward every one hundred presses, and again it will wise up. It will start pressing more on the lever when the reward is close (pigeons are better counters than you'd think!) and ease off after it obtains the reward. Again, if it doesn't get its reward after about a hundred presses, the behavior will become extinct pretty quickly.<br /><br />To these two basic schedules of fixed reinforcement, Skinner added variable reinforcement: essentially the same but with a random factor built in. Instead of giving a reward once an hour, the pigeon may get a reward in a randomly chosen time between 30 and 90 minutes. Or instead of giving a reward every hundred presses, it might take somewhere between 50 and 150.<br /><br />Put a pigeon in a box on variable interval schedule, and you'll get constant lever presses and good resistance to extinction.<br /><br />Put a pigeon in a box with a variable ratio schedule and you get a situation one of my professors unscientifically but accurately described as \"pure evil\". The pigeon will become obsessed with pecking as much as possible, and really you can stop giving rewards at all after a while and the pigeon will never wise up.<br /><br />Skinner was not the first person to place an animal in front of a lever that delivered reinforcement based on a variable ratio schedule. That honor goes to Charles Fey, inventor of the slot machine.<br /><br />So it looks like some of this stuff has relevance for humans as well<sup>4</sup>. Tomorrow: more freshman psychology lecture material. Hooray!<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>FOOTNOTES</strong></p>\n<p>1. Of course, it's not really psychology unless you can think of an unethical yet hilarious application, so I refer you to <a href=\"http://bmo.sagepub.com/content/23/2/254.abstract\">Plaud and Martini's study</a> in which slides of erotic stimuli (naked women) were paired with slides of non-erotic stimuli (penny jars) to give male experimental subjects a penny jar fetish; this supports a theory that uses chance pairing of sexual and non-sexual stimuli to explain normal fetish formation.</p>\n<p>2. The bizarre rumor that B.F. Skinner raised his daughter in a Skinner box <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/science/skinner.asp\">is completely false</a>. The rumor that he marketed a child-rearing device called an <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S108926800200056X\">\"Heir Conditioner\"</a> is, remarkably, true.</p>\n<p>3: In technical literature, behaviorists actually use four terms: positive reinforcement, positive punishment, negative reinforcement, and negative punishment. This is really confusing: \"negative reinforcement\" is actually a type of reward, behavior like going near wasps is \"punished\" even though we usually use \"punishment\" to mean deliberate human action, and all four terms can be summed up under the category \"reinforcement\" even though reinforcement is also sometimes used to mean \"reward as opposed to punishment\". I'm going to try to simplify things here by using \"positive reinforcement\" as a synonym for \"reward\" and \"negative reinforcement\" as a synonym for \"punishment\", same way the rest of the non-academic world does it.<br /><br />4: Also relevant: checking HP:MoR for updates is variable interval reinforcement. You never know when an update's coming, but it doesn't come faster the more times you reload fanfiction.net. As predicted, even when Eliezer goes weeks without updating, the behavior continues to persist.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null,

interesting responses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/008165.html\"><span class=\"title\">If We Are In A Computer Simulation</span></a></p>\n<p>Is the universe just a big computer simulation running in another universe? Suppose it is. Then I've got some questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are intelligent entities modeled as objects? In other words, are  they instantiated and managed as distinct tracked pieces in the  simulation? Or is the universe just modeled as huge numbers of subatomic  particles and energy?</li>\n<li>If intelligences aren't modeled as objects are they at least tracked  or studied by whoever is running the sim? Or is the evolution of  intelligence in the sim just seen as an uninteresting side effect and  irrelevant to the sim's purposes?</li>\n<li>Is The Big Bang the moment the sim started running? Or did it start  long before that point? Or has it been started at a much later point  with data loading in to make it look like it started earlier?</li>\n<li>Do the creators of the sim intervene as it runs? Do they patch it?</li>\n<li>What is the purpose of the sim? Entertainment? Political decision-making? Scientific research?</li>\n<li>Were the physical laws of the universe designed to reduce the  computational cost of the sim? If so, what aspects of the physical laws  were designed to make computation cheaper?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Imagine the purpose of the sim is entertainment or decision-making.  Either way, it could be that out-of-universe sentient beings actually  enter this universe and interact with some of its intelligent entities.  Interact with simulated people for fun. Or interact in order to try out  different experiments of political development. In the latter case I  would expect more rerunning of the same sim backed up to restart at the  same point but with some alteration of what some people say or do.</p>\n<p>So what's your (simulated) gut feeling? Are you in a sim? If so, what's it for?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Any thoughts?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource":

A stronger <em>chavruta</em> will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a <em>chavruta</em> who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker <em>chavruta</em>, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, and be ready to justify each and every point. The stronger <em>chavruta</em> helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker <em>chavruta</em> helps the student learn <em>how</em> to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of <em>chavrutas</em> in order to develop on all three levels.<sup id=\"cite_ref-zobin_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chavruta#cite_note-zobin-6\"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>\n<p>Given the pattern their interactions have followed online in the past, one could easily think of classifying Yudkowsky and Hanson's relationship as an informal chavruta. And perhaps we should follow their example: <a href=\"/lw/6ir/dark_arts_schopenhauer_wrote_the_book_on_how_to/4gyz\">Endoself</a> expressed the desire for such a companion, and suggested that we at Less Wrong establish some similar institution.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I don't just think this institution should be introduced into Less Wrong. I think it need to be introduced into every educational system.

It's kind of a collective effort. Therefore, I'm not quite sure we need such an institution on the site proper, since we seem to function like a huge hydra of a chavruta right now. Which we shall demonstrate right now, as usual, in the comments section, where I'll be impatiently waiting for feedback from both Jews and Gentiles.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true,

One way would be for me to pay you X dollars every year until 2020. Then, if the apocalypse doesn't happen, you pay me 2X dollars every year until 2030.

behavioral sequences in an online world</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We study behavioral action sequences of players in a massive multiplayer online game. In their virtual life players use eight basic actions which allow them to interact with each other. These actions are communication, trade, establishing or breaking friendships and enmities, attack, and punishment. We measure the probabilities for these actions conditional on previous taken and received actions and find a dramatic increase of negative behavior immediately after receiving negative actions. Similarly, positive behavior is intensified by receiving positive actions. We observe a tendency towards anti-persistence in communication sequences. Classifying actions as positive (good) and negative (bad) allows us to define binary 'world lines' of lives of individuals. Positive and negative actions are persistent and occur in clusters, indicated by large scaling exponents alpha~0.87 of the mean square displacement of the world lines. For all eight action types we find strong signs for high levels of repetitiveness, especially for negative actions. We partition behavioral sequences into segments of length n (behavioral `words' and 'motifs') and study their statistical properties. We find two approximate power laws in the word ranking distribution, one with an exponent of kappa-1 for the ranks up to 100, and another with a lower exponent for higher ranks. The Shannon n-tuple redundancy yields large values and increases in terms of word length, further underscoring the non-trivial statistical properties of behavioral sequences. On the collective, societal level the timeseries of particular actions per day can be understood by a simple mean-reverting log-normal model.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Link:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0392\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0392</a></p>\n<p><strong>Popular science interpretation:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The way patterns of behaviour emerge and spread through society is the subject of intense research at the moment.</p>\n<p>[...] behaviours spread from one network to another, for example, an  angry phone conversation can affect the next email you write.</p>\n<p>Today, Stefan Thurner at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and a  couple of pals [...]  study the patterns of behaviour that emerge in a virtual world where  every interaction is recorded for posterity.</p>\n<p>The world they've chosen is a massive multiplayer online game called  Pardus, which started in 2004 and today has some 380,00 players.</p>\n<p>Thurner and co studied eight basic actions in which players interact  with each other. These are: communication, trade, establishing or  breaking friendships and enmities, attack and punishment.  They simply  recorded the stream of actions that each player performs and then looked  for patterns that occur more often than expected.</p>\n<p>Their conclusions are straightforward to state. Thurner and co found  that positive behaviour intensifies after an individual receives a  positive action.</p>\n<p>However, they also found a far more dramatic increase in negative  behaviour immediately after an individual receives a negative action.  \"<strong>The probability of acting out negative actions is about 10 times higher  if a person received a negative action at the previous timestep than if  she received a positive action</strong>,\" they say.</p>\n<p>Negative action is also more likely to be repeated than merely reciprocated, which is why it spreads more effectively.</p>\n<p>So negative actions seem to be more infectious than positive ones.</p>\n<p>However, players with a high fraction of negative actions tend to have  shorter lives. Thurner and co speculate that there may be two reasons  for this: \"First because they are hunted down by others and give up  playing, second because they are unable to maintain a social life and  quit the game because of loneliness or frustration.\"</p>\n<p>So <strong>the bottom line is that the society tends towards positive behaviour</strong>.</p>\n<p>[...] it opens a new front in the study of the human condition and the origin of good and bad behaviour.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>\"<strong>We interpret these \ufb01ndings as empirical evidence for self organization  towards reciprocal, good conduct within a human society</strong>,\" they say.</p>\n<p>[...] <em>(popsci author note)</em> Maybe.

Classifying actions as positive (good) and negative (bad) allows us to define binary 'world lines' of lives of individuals. Positive and negative actions are persistent and occur in clusters, indicated by large scaling exponents alpha~0.87 of the mean square displacement of the world lines. For all eight action types we find strong signs for high levels of repetitiveness, especially for negative actions. We partition behavioral sequences into segments of length n (behavioral `words' and 'motifs') and study their statistical properties. We find two approximate power laws in the word ranking distribution, one with an exponent of kappa-1 for the ranks up to 100, and another with a lower exponent for higher ranks. The Shannon n-tuple redundancy yields large values and increases in terms of word length, further underscoring the non-trivial statistical properties of behavioral sequences. On the collective, societal level the timeseries of particular actions per day can be understood by a simple mean-reverting log-normal model.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong id=\"Link_\">Link:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0392\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0392</a></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Popular_science_interpretation_\">Popular science interpretation:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The way patterns of behaviour emerge and spread through society is the subject of intense research at the moment.</p>\n<p>[...] behaviours spread from one network to another, for example, an  angry phone conversation can affect the next email you write.</p>\n<p>Today, Stefan Thurner at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and a  couple of pals [...]  study the patterns of behaviour that emerge in a virtual world where  every interaction is recorded for posterity.</p>\n<p>The world they've chosen is a massive multiplayer online game called  Pardus, which started in 2004 and today has some 380,00 players.</p>\n<p>Thurner and co studied eight basic actions in which players interact  with each other.

Is this a violation of behaviorist principles?<br /><br />No. For one thing, yesterday's post included a description of secondary reinforcers, those reinforcers which are not hard-coded evolutionary goods like food and sex, but which nevertheless have a conditioned association with good things. Money is the classic case of a secondary reinforcer among humans. Little colored rectangles are not naturally reinforcing, but from a very young age most humans learn that they can be used to buy pleasant things, like candy or toys or friends. Behaviorist-inspired experiments on humans often use money as a reward, and have yet to run into many experimental subjects whom it fails to motivate<sup>1</sup>.<br /><br />Speaking of friends, status may be a primary reinforcer specific to social animals. I don't know if being able to literally feel reinforcement going on is a real thing, but I maintain I can feel the rush of reward when someone gives me a compliment. If that's too unscientific for you, consider <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797023\">studies</a> in which monkeys will \"exchange\" sugary juice for the opportunity to look at pictures of high status monkeys, but demand extra juice in exchange for looking at pictures of low status monkeys.<br /><br />Although certain cynics might consider money and status an exhaustive list, we may also add moral, aesthetic, and value-based considerations. Evolutionary psychology explains why these might exist and Bandura called some of them \"internal reinforcement\".<br /><br />But more complicated reinforcers alone are not sufficient to bridge the gap between lever-pushing pigeons and human behavior. Humans have an ability to select for or against behaviors without trying them. For example: most of us would avoid going up to Mr. T and giving him the finger. But most of us have not personally tried this behavior and observed the consequences. <br /><br />Is this the result of pure reason? No; the rational part of our mind is the part telling us that Mr. T is probably sixty years old by now and far too deep in the media spotlight to want to risk a scandal and jail time by beating up a random stranger. So where exactly is the reluctance coming from?</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a><br /><strong>GENERALIZATION</strong><br /><br />Roko wrote in his post <a href=\"/lw/21b/ugh_fields/\">Ugh Fields</a> that \"your brain propagates psychological pain back to the earliest reliable stimulus for the punishment\". This deserves more investigation.<br /><br />Suppose you did go into a bar one night, see Mr. T, give him the finger, and get beaten up. What behavior would you avoid in the future based on this experience? The event itself does not immediately provide enough information to distinguish among \"don't go into bars\", \"don't go out at night\", \"don't interact with people who have facial hair\", and the correct answer \"don't offend scary-looking people\". This information has to come from your pre-existing model of reality, your brain's evolved background assumptions, and some clever guesswork.<br /><br />Let's get back to the hilariously unethical experiments. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Albert_experiment\">Little Albert</a> was an eight month old child who briefly starred in an experiment by behaviorist John Watson. Watson showed him a fuzzy white rat. Albert seemed to like the rat well enough. After Albert liking the rat had been confirmed, Watson showed him the rat again, but this time also played a very loud and scary noise; he repeated this intervention until, as expected, Albert was terrified of the white rat.<br /><br />But it wasn't just fuzzy white rats Albert didn't like. Further investigation determined that Albert was also afraid of brown rabbits (fuzzy animal) and Santa Claus (fuzzy white beard). With his incipient powers of categorization, he had learned to associate punishment with a broad category of things vaguely clustered around fuzzy white rats.<br /><br />B.F. Skinner had an even more interesting experiment that showed what happened when feedback of consequences went wrong. He put pigeons in a box that gave them rewards randomly. The pigeons ended up developing what he called \"superstitions\"; if a reward arrived by coincidence when a pigeon was tilting its head in a certain direction, the pigeon would continue tilting its head in that direction in the hope of gaining more rewards; when the reward randomly arrived, the pigeon took this as \"justification\" of its head-tilting and head-tilted even more<sup>2</sup>.<br /><br />This provides one piece of the puzzle in the Mr. T question. None of us have ever given Mr. T the finger before. But we may have offended scary-looking people and had bad things happen to us, which our brains correctly generalize to \"don't offend scary-looking people\".<br /><br /><strong>SOCIAL LEARNING</strong><br /><br />Or maybe not. Maybe you've never offended a scary-looking person before. what then?<br /><br />Social learning theory is held up as opposed to behaviorism a lot, but it seems more like a natural extension of it. Humans and animals learn behaviors not just by being rewarded or punished themselves, but in observing whether a behavior is rewarded or punished in others.<br /><br />Even if we ourselves have never offended scary-looking people, we have seen other people do so, or heard stories about people doing so, or watched people do so on TV.<br /><br />At this point I have to mention my favorite social learning story ever, which also illustrates the pitfalls of trying to feedback consequences to their proximal cause. There has been some hand-wringing lately about children's TV shows and whether they lead to developmental problems in children. A <a href=\"http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/~dgentile/pdfs/ostrov_gentile_crick_in_press.pdf\">study by Ostrov and Gentile</a> cited in <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/nurture-shock.html\">NurtureShock</a> found the expected correlation between violent TV shows and physical aggression, but also found a an even stronger correlation between <em>educational</em> TV shows and so-called \"relational aggression\" - things like bullying, name-calling, and deliberate ostracism. The shows most strongly correlated with bad behavior were heart-warming educational programs intended to teach morality. Why?</p>\n<p>The researchers theorize that the structure of these shows often involved a child committing an immoral action, the child looking cool and strong, and then at the end of the show the child eventually gets a comeuppance (think Harry Potter, where evil character Draco Malfoy is the coolest and most popular kid in Hogwarts and usually gets away with it, whereas supposedly sympathetic character Ron Weasley is at best a lovable loser who spends most of his time as the butt of Draco's jokes). The theory is that children are just not good enough at the whole feedback of conseqeunces thing to realize that the bully's comeuppance in the end is supposed to be the inevitable result of their evil ways. All they see is someone being a bully and then being treated as obviously popular and high-status.<br /><br />Behavior is selection by consequences, and status is a strong reinforcer. If children see other children behaving as bullies and having high status, then all else being equal, they will be more likely to behave as bullies.<br /><br />These two phenomena - feedback to categories and social learning - go part of the way to explaining the original question of how people have strong preferences for or against behaviors they've never tried before.</p>\n<p><strong>INTERNAL REINFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n<p>The phrase \"internal reinforcement\" would make good behaviorists cringe, seeing as it takes a perfectly good predictive model of behavior and tries to pin it on invisible mental phenomena.</p>\n<p>But all reinforcement has to be at least a <em>little</em> internal; an animal wouldn't know that eating food was good and eating rocks was bad unless some internal structure <em>knew</em> to reinforce food-eating behavior but not rock-eating behavior. Some reinforcement seems even more internal than that; people may continue an activity solely because it makes them feel good about themselves.</p>\n<p>This is not any more mysterious than eating behavior - the drive for food and the drive for status as measured in self-esteem are both perfectly legitimate biological drives, and it's not surprising that we have structures for noticing when we satisfy them and reinforcing the behavior involved - but it sure does <em>sound</em> less scientific.</p>\n<p><strong>STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH</strong><br /><br />Much to the chagrin of behaviorists, all these mechanisms are still not sufficient to completely explain human behavior. Some cases - for example a patient who quits an enjoyable smoking habit because the doctor says it will cause cancer - may not fit any of these patterns. The patient may not previously have encountered any problems, personally or vicariously, with smoking or anything sufficiently similar to smoking to justify generalization, and positing internal reinforcement just moves the problem to another level.<br /><br />Daniel Dennett speaks of</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a sort of inner environment, in which tryouts can be safely executed - an inner something-or-other structured in such a way that the surrogate actions it favors are more often than not the very actions the real world would also bless, if they were actually performed. In short, the inner environment, whatever it is, must contain lots of information about the outer environment and its regularities. Nothing else (except magic) could provide preselection worth having.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is some evidence for this sort of thing in certain cases: in <a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001092\">experiments on fictive reinforcement</a>, people who stayed out of a simulated rising stock market, thus breaking even when they could have won a lot of money, were found on MRI to have a reinforcement signal almost as if they were simulating the case in which they had entered the stock market and been reinforced for doing so.<br /><br />But overall this idea involves too much magic and doesn't correspond to the way we really make decisions, either as perceived intuitively or as detected by most experiments. It also doesn't explain why we're so <em>bad</em> at being motivated by this sort of reinforcement: for example, since I know that heroin is really really enjoyable, why can't I become addicted to heroin just by thinking about it? And how come the overwhelming majority of patients don't quit smoking when their doctor tells them to do so, but people often do quit smoking after they've personally experienced the negative consequences (eg had their first heart attack)?<br /><br />I am more favorable to the idea of a neural net model in which medical advice can forge a weak connection between the \"smoking\" pattern and the \"cancer\" pattern through cognition alone, separate from reinforcement processes but allowing such processes to propagate down it. Not a whole lot of motivational force can travel down such a weak link, blocking it from being effective against a strong desire to keep smoking. But I've got to admit that's a wild guess.<br /><br />The important point, though, is that just as utility theory posits not just utility but expected utility, reinforcement learning posits not just reward but <em>expected reward</em>. Many processes by which we compute expected reward remain vague. Others have been explored in some detail. The next two posts will make up for the vagueness of this one by discussing some properties of the expected reward function.<br /><br /><br /><strong>FOOTNOTES:</strong></p>\n<p>1.

people any credit for anything they do.&nbsp; All good deeds are ultimately done for \"selfish\" reasons, where even having a goal of helping other people counts as selfish.&nbsp; The quote from Lukeprog's recent article is a perfect example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No one deserves thanks from another about something he has done for him or goodness he has done. He is either willing to get a reward from God, therefore he wanted to serve himself. Or he wanted to get a reward from people, therefore he has done that to get profit for himself. Or to be mentioned and praised by people, therefore, it is also for himself. Or due to his mercy and tenderheartedness, so he has simply done that goodness to pacify these feelings and treat himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p align=\"right\">- Mohammed Ibn Al-Jahm Al-Barmaki</p>\n<p>Another group of people doesn't want to blame people for anything they do.&nbsp; Criminals sometimes had criminal parents - crime was in their environment <em>and</em> in their genes.&nbsp; Or, to take a different variety of this attitude, cultural beliefs that seem horrible to us are always justifiable within their own cultural context.</p>\n<p>The funny thing is that these are different groups.&nbsp; Both assert that people should not be given credit, or else blame, for their actions, beyond the degree of free will that they had.&nbsp; Yet you rarely find the same person who will not give people credit for their good deeds unwilling to blame them for their bad deeds, or vice-versa.</p>\n<p>When you find yourself in an argument that appears to be about free will, but is really about credit or blame, ask the person to agree that the matter applies equally to good deeds and bad deeds - however they define those terms.&nbsp; This may make them lose interest in the argument - because it no longer does what they want it to do.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false,

been working on in the discussion section. Thanks to all the commenters there, and special thanks to atucker, Gabriel, Jonathan_Graehl, kpreid, XiXiDu, and Yvain for helping me express myself more clearly.</em></p>\n<p><em>-------------------</em></p>\n<p>For the most part, I am excited about growing as a rationalist. I attended the Berkeley <a href=\"/lw/5ec/minicamp_on_rationality_awesomeness_and/\">minicamp</a>; I play with <a href=\"/lw/3px/anki_deck_for_biases_and_fallacies/\">Anki</a> cards and <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20100/wits-wagers\">Wits &amp; Wagers</a>; I use Google Scholar and spreadsheets to try to predict the consequences of my actions.</p>\n<p>There is a part of me, though, that bristles at some of the rationalist 'culture' on Less Wrong, for lack of a better word. The advice, the tone, the vibe 'feels' wrong, somehow. If you forced me to use more precise language, I might say that, for several years now, I have kept a variety of procedural heuristics running in the background that help me ferret out bullshit, partisanship, wishful thinking, and other unsound debating tactics -- and important content on this website manages to trigger most of them. Yvain suggests that something about the rapid spread of positive affect not obviously tied to any concrete accomplishments may be stimulating a sort of anti-viral <a href=\"/lw/6cx/an_outside_view_on_less_wrongs_advice/4gdg\">memetic defense system</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that I am *not* claiming that Less Wrong is a cult. Nobody who runs a cult has such a good sense of&nbsp;<a href=\"/lw/m4/two_cult_koans/#more\">humor</a>&nbsp;about it. And if they do, they're so dangerous that it doesn't matter what I say about it. No, if anything, \"cultishness\" is a straw man. Eliezer will <strong>not</strong> make you abandon your friends and family, run away to a far-off mountain retreat and drink poison Kool-Aid. But, he *might* convince you to believe in some very silly things and take some very silly actions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in the spirit of <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill#Ch._II:_Of_the_Liberty_of_Thought_and_Discussion\">John Stuart Mill</a>, I am writing a one-article attack on much of we seem to hold dear. If there is anything true about what I'm saying, you will want to read it, so that you can alter your commitments accordingly. Even if, as seems more likely, you don't believe a word I say, reading a semi-intelligent attack on your values and mentally responding to it will probably help you more clearly understand what it is that you do believe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Wishful Thinking</strong></h2>\n<p>As far as I can tell, some of the most prominent themes in terms of short-term behavioral advice being given on Less Wrong are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) <a href=\"/lw/1mc/cryonicists_surprisingly_normal_except_for_one/\">Sign</a> <a href=\"/lw/wq/you_only_live_twice/\">up</a> <a href=\"/lw/wq/you_only_live_twice/\">for</a> <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cryonics\">cryonics</a>,</p>\n<p>2) <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/8586168\">Donate</a> <a href=\"/lw/4qe/how_to_improve_the_public_perception_of_the_siai/\">to</a> <a href=\"/lw/5il/siai_an_examination/\">SIAI</a>,</p>\n<p>3) <a href=\"/lw/oy/is_humanism_a_religionsubstitute/\">Drop</a> <a href=\"/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/\">out</a> of any <a href=\"/lw/3mm/back_to_the_basics_of_rationality/\">religious</a> groups you might <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LessWrong\">belong</a> to, and</p>\n<p>4) <a href=\"/lw/45u/a_rationalists_guide_to_psychoactive_drugs/\">Take</a> <a href=\"/lw/1w1/coffee_when_it_helps_when_it_hurts/\">chemical</a> <a href=\"/lw/1sm/akrasia_tactics_review/\">stimulants</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I don't mean to imply that this is the *only* advice given, or even that these are the four most important ones. Rather, I claim that these four topics, taken together, account for a large share of the behavioral advice dispensed here. I predict that you would find it difficult or impossible to construct a list of four other pieces of behavioral advice such that people would reliably say that your list is more fairly representative of the advice on Less Wrong. As XiXiDu was kind enough to put it, there is numerical evidence to suggest that my list is \"<a href=\"/lw/6cx/an_outside_view_on_less_wrongs_advice/4ge5\">not entirely unfounded</a>.\"</p>\n<p>The problem with this advice is that, for certain kinds of tech/geek minds, the advice is extremely well-optimized for <a href=\"/econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/micfoundrev.doc\">cheaply</a> supporting pleasurable yet useless beliefs -- a kind of <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading\">wireheading</a> that works on your prefrontal cortex instead of directly on your pleasure centers.</p>\n<p>By cheaply, I mean that the beliefs won't really hurt you...it's relatively safe to believe in them. If you believe that traffic in the U.S. drives on the left-hand-side of the street, that's a very expensive belief; no matter happy you are thinking that you, and only you, know the amazing secret of LeftTrafficIsm, you won't get to experience that happiness for very long, because you'll get into an auto accident by tomorrow at the latest. By contrast, believing that your vote in the presidential primaries makes a big difference to the outcome of the election is a relatively cheap belief. You can go around for several years thinking of yourself as an important, empowered, responsible citizen, and all it costs you is a few hours (tops) of waiting in line at a polling station. In both cases, you are objectively and obviously wrong -- but in one case, you 'purchase' a lot of pleasure with a little bit of wrongness, and in the other case, you purchase a little bit of pleasure with a tremendous amount of wrongness.</p>\n<p>Among the general public, one popular cheap belief to 'buy' is that&nbsp;a benevolent, powerful God will take you away to magical happy sunshine-land after you die, if and only if you're a nice person who doesn't commit suicide.&nbsp;As it's stated, indulging in that belief doesn't cost you much in terms of your ability to achieve your other goals, and it gives you something pleasant to think about. This belief is unpopular with the kind of people who are attracted to Less Wrong, <em>even before they get here</em>, because we are much less likely to <a href=\"/lw/1zu/compartmentalization_as_a_passive_phenomenon/\">compartmentalize</a>&nbsp;our beliefs.</p>\n<p>If you have a sufficiently separate compartment for religion, you can believe in heaven without much affecting your belief in evolution. God's up there, bacteria are down here, and that's pretty much the end of it. If you have an integrated, physical, reductionist model of the Universe, though, believing in heaven would be very expensive, because it would undermine your hard-won confidence in lots of other practically useful beliefs. If there are spirits floating around in Heaven somewhere, how do you know there aren't spirits in your water making homeopathy work? If there's a benevolent God watching us, how do you know He hasn't magically guided you to the career that best suits you? And so on. For geeks, believing in heaven is a lousy bargain, because it costs way too much in terms of practical navigation ability to be worth the warm fuzzy thoughts.</p>\n<p>Enter...cryonics and friendly AI. Oh, look! Using only physical, reductionist-friendly mechanisms, we can show that a benevolent, powerful entity whose mind is not centered on any particular point in space (let's call it 'Sysop' instead of God) might someday start watching over us. As an added bonus, as long as we don't commit suicide by throwing our bodies into the dirt as soon as our hearts stop beating, we can wake up in the future using the power of cryonics! The future will be kinder, richer, and generally more fun than the present...much like magical happy sunshine-land is better than Earth.</p>\n<p>Unlike pre-scientific religion, the \"cryonics + Friendly AI\" Sysop story is 'cheap' for people who rarely compartmentalize. You can believe in Sysop without needing to believe in anything that can't be explained in terms of charge, momentum, spin, and other fundamental physical properties. Like pre-scientific religion, the Sysop story is a whole lot of fun to think about and believe in. It makes you happy! That, in and of itself, doesn't make you wrong, but it is very important to stay aware of the <a href=\"/lw/js/the_bottom_line/\">true causes of your beliefs</a>. If you came to believe a relatively strange and complicated idea because it made you happy, it is very unlikely that this same idea just happens to also be strongly entangled with reality.</p>\n<h2>Partisanship</h2>\n<p>As for dropping out of other religious communities, well, they're the quintessential bad guys, right? Not only do they believe in all kinds of unsubstantiated woo, they suck you into a dense network of personal relationships -- which we at Less Wrong want <a href=\"/lw/4un/towards_a_bay_area_less_wrong_community/\">earnestly</a> to <a href=\"/lw/6ca/community_roles_committees_and_leadership/\">re-create</a>, just, you know, without any of the religion stuff. The less emotional attachment you have to your old community, the more you'll be free and available to help bootstrap ours!</p>\n<p>Why should you spend all your time trying to get one of the first rationalist communities up and running (hard) instead of joining a pre-existing, respectable religious community (easy)? Well, to be fair, there are <a href=\"/lw/4ul/less_wrong_nyc_case_study_of_a_successful/\">lots</a> of good reasons. Depending on how rationalist you are, you might strongly prefer the company of other rationalists, both as people to be intimate with and as people to try to run committee meetings with. If you're naturally different enough from the mainstream, it could be more fun and less frustrating for you to just join up with a minority group, despite the extra effort needed to build it up.</p>\n<p>There is a meme on Less Wrong, though, that rationalist communities are not just better-suited to the unique needs of rationalists, but also better in general. Rationality is the <a href=\"/lw/6cv/entangled_with_reality_the_shoelace_example/\">lens that sees its own flaws</a>. We get along better, get fit faster, have more fun, and know how to do more things well. Through rationality, we learn to <a href=\"/lw/5c0/epistle_to_the_new_york_less_wrongians/\">optimize</a> everything in sight. Rationality should ultimately <a href=\"/lw/4v5/effective_rationality_outreach/\">eat the whole world</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, you have to ask yourself: what are the odds that these beliefs are driven by valid evidence, as opposed to <a href=\"/lw/i7/belief_as_attire/\">ordinary human instincts</a> for supporting their own tribe and denigrating their neighbors? As Eliezer very fairly acknowledges, we don't even have decent metrics for measuring rationality itself, let alone for measuring the real-world effects that rationality supposedly has or will have on people's wealth, health, <a href=\"/lw/5t/can_humanism_match_religions_output/\">altruism</a>, reported happiness, etc.</p>\n<p>Do we *really* identify our own flaws and then act accordingly, or do we just accept the teachings of professional neuroscientists -- who may or may not be rationalists -- and invent just-so stories 'explaining' how our present or future conduct dovetails with those teachings? Take the \"foveal blind spot\" that tricks us into perceiving stars in the night sky as <a href=\"/lw/6cv/entangled_with_reality_the_shoelace_example/\">disappearing</a> when you look straight at them. Do you (or anyone you know) really have the skill to identify a biological human flaw, connect it with an observed phenomenon, and then deviate from conventional wisdom on the strength of your analysis? If mainstream scientists believed that stars don't give off any light that strikes the Earth directly head-on, would you be able to find, digest, and apply the idea of foveal blind spots in order to prove them wrong? If not, do you still think that rationalist communities are better than other communities for intelligent but otherwise ordinary people? Why?</p>\n<p>It would be <em>really convenient</em>&nbsp;if rationality, the meme-cluster that we most enjoy and are best-equipped to participate in, also happened to be the best for winning at life. In case it turns out that life is not quite so convenient, maybe we should be a little humbler about our grand experiment. Even if we have good reason to assert that mainstream religious thinking is flawed, maybe we should be slower to advise people to give up the <a href=\"/lw/4su/how_to_be_happy/\">health benefits</a> (footnote 15) of belonging, emotionally, to one or another religious community.</p>\n<h2>Bullshit</h2>\n<p>Finally, suppose you publicly declared yourself to have nigh-on-magical powers -- by virtue of this strange thing that few people in your area understand, \"rationality,\" you can make yourself smarter, more disciplined, more fun to be around, and generally awesome-r. Of course, rationality takes time to blossom -- everyone understands that; you make it clear. You do not presently have <a href=\"/lw/y5/the_babyeating_aliens_18/\">big angelic powers</a>, it is just that you will get your hands on them soon.</p>\n<p>A few months go by, maybe a year, and while you have *fascinating* insights into cognitive biases, institutional inefficiencies, and quantum physics, your friends either can't understand them or are bored to tears by your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphaloskepsis\">omphaloskepsis</a>. You need to come up with something that will actually impress them, and soon, or you'll suffer from cognitive dissonance and might have to back off of your pleasurable belief that rationality is better than other belief systems.</p>\n<p>Lo and behold, you discover the amazing benefits of chemical stimulants! Your arcane insights into the flaws of the institutional medical establishment and your amazing ability to try out different experimental approaches and faithfully record which ones work best have allowed you to safely take drugs that the lay world shuns as overly dangerous. These drugs do, in fact, boost your productivity, your apparent energy, and your mood. You appear to be smarter and more fun than those around you who are not on rationally identified stimulants. Chalk one up for rationality.</p>\n<p>Unless, of course, the drugs have undesirable long-term or medium-term effects. Maybe you develop tolerance and have to take larger and larger doses. Maybe you wear out your liver or your kidneys, or lower your bone density. Maybe you mis-underestimate your ability to operate heavy machinery on polyphasic sleep cycles, and drive off the side of the road. Less Wrong is too young, as a meme cluster, for most of these hazards to have been triggered. I wouldn't bet on any one of those outcomes for any one drug...but if your answer to the challenges of life is to self-medicate, you're taking on a whole lot more risk than the present maturity of the discipline of rationality would seem to warrant.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I've tried my best <em>not </em>to frontally engage any of the <em>internal</em>&nbsp;techniques or justifications of rationality. On what Robin Hanson would call an inside view, rationality looks very, very attractive, even to me. By design, I have not argued here that, e.g., it is difficult to revive a frozen human brain, or that the FDA is the best judge of which drugs are safe.</p>\n<p>What I have tried to do instead is imagine rationality and all its parts as a black box, and ask: what goes into it, and what comes out of it? What goes in is a bunch of smart nonconformists. What comes out, at least so far, is some strange advice. The advice pays off on kind of a bimodal curve: cryonics and SIAI pay off at least a decade in the future, if at all, whereas drugs and quitting religion offer excellent rewards now, but may involve heavy costs down the road.</p>\n<p>The relative dearth of s<em>ustainable yet immediate </em>behavioral&nbsp;payoffs coming out of the box leads me to suspect that the people who go into the box go there not so much to learn about superior behaviors, but to learn about superior beliefs. The main sense in which the beliefs are superior in terms of their ability to make tech/geek people think happy thoughts without 'paying' too much in bad outcomes.</p>\n<p>I hold this suspicion with about 30% confidence. That's not enough to make me want to abandon the rationalist project -- I think, on balance, it still makes sense for us to try to figure this stuff out. It <em>is</em> enough for me to want to proceed more carefully. I would like to see an emphasis on low-hanging fruit. What can we safely accomplish this month? this year? I would like to see warnings and disclaimers. Instead of blithely informing everyone else of how awesome we are, maybe we should give a cheerful yet balanced description of the costs and benefits. It's OK to say that we think the benefits outweigh the costs...but, in a 2-minute conversation, the idea of costs should be acknowledged at least once. Finally, I would like to see more emphasis on testing and measuring rationality. I will work on figuring out ways to do this, and if anyone has any good measurement schemes, I will be happy to donate some of my money and/or time to support them.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true,

a <a href=\"/lw/6cx/an_outside_view_on_less_wrongs_advice/\">post</a> that I have been working on in the discussion section. Thanks to all the commenters there, and special thanks to atucker, Gabriel, Jonathan_Graehl, kpreid, XiXiDu, and Yvain for helping me express myself more clearly.</em></p>\n<p><em>-------------------</em></p>\n<p>For the most part, I am excited about growing as a rationalist. I attended the Berkeley <a href=\"/lw/5ec/minicamp_on_rationality_awesomeness_and/\">minicamp</a>; I play with <a href=\"/lw/3px/anki_deck_for_biases_and_fallacies/\">Anki</a> cards and <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20100/wits-wagers\">Wits &amp; Wagers</a>; I use Google Scholar and spreadsheets to try to predict the consequences of my actions.</p>\n<p>There is a part of me, though, that bristles at some of the rationalist 'culture' on Less Wrong, for lack of a better word. The advice, the tone, the vibe 'feels' wrong, somehow. If you forced me to use more precise language, I might say that, for several years now, I have kept a variety of procedural heuristics running in the background that help me ferret out bullshit, partisanship, wishful thinking, and other unsound debating tactics -- and important content on this website manages to trigger most of them. Yvain suggests that something about the rapid spread of positive affect not obviously tied to any concrete accomplishments may be stimulating a sort of anti-viral <a href=\"/lw/6cx/an_outside_view_on_less_wrongs_advice/4gdg\">memetic defense system</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that I am *not* claiming that Less Wrong is a cult. Nobody who runs a cult has such a good sense of&nbsp;<a href=\"/lw/m4/two_cult_koans/#more\">humor</a>&nbsp;about it. And if they do, they're so dangerous that it doesn't matter what I say about it. No, if anything, \"cultishness\" is a straw man. Eliezer will <strong>not</strong> make you abandon your friends and family, run away to a far-off mountain retreat and drink poison Kool-Aid. But, he *might* convince you to believe in some very silly things and take some very silly actions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in the spirit of <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill#Ch._II:_Of_the_Liberty_of_Thought_and_Discussion\">John Stuart Mill</a>, I am writing a one-article attack on much of we seem to hold dear. If there is anything true about what I'm saying, you will want to read it, so that you can alter your commitments accordingly. Even if, as seems more likely, you don't believe a word I say, reading a semi-intelligent attack on your values and mentally responding to it will probably help you more clearly understand what it is that you do believe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Wishful_Thinking\"><strong>Wishful Thinking</strong></h2>\n<p>As far as I can tell, some of the most prominent themes in terms of short-term behavioral advice being given on Less Wrong are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) <a href=\"/lw/1mc/cryonicists_surprisingly_normal_except_for_one/\">Sign</a> <a href=\"/lw/wq/you_only_live_twice/\">up</a> <a href=\"/lw/wq/you_only_live_twice/\">for</a> <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cryonics\">cryonics</a>,</p>\n<p>2) <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/8586168\">Donate</a> <a href=\"/lw/4qe/how_to_improve_the_public_perception_of_the_siai/\">to</a> <a href=\"/lw/5il/siai_an_examination/\">SIAI</a>,</p>\n<p>3) <a href=\"/lw/oy/is_humanism_a_religionsubstitute/\">Drop</a> <a href=\"/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/\">out</a> of any <a href=\"/lw/3mm/back_to_the_basics_of_rationality/\">religious</a> groups you might <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LessWrong\">belong</a> to, and</p>\n<p>4) <a href=\"/lw/45u/a_rationalists_guide_to_psychoactive_drugs/\">Take</a> <a href=\"/lw/1w1/coffee_when_it_helps_when_it_hurts/\">chemical</a> <a href=\"/lw/1sm/akrasia_tactics_review/\">stimulants</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I don't mean to imply that this is the *only* advice given, or even that these are the four most important ones. Rather, I claim that these four topics, taken together, account for a large share of the behavioral advice dispensed here. I predict that you would find it difficult or impossible to construct a list of four other pieces of behavioral advice such that people would reliably say that your list is more fairly representative of the advice on Less Wrong. As XiXiDu was kind enough to put it, there is numerical evidence to suggest that my list is \"<a href=\"/lw/6cx/an_outside_view_on_less_wrongs_advice/4ge5\">not entirely unfounded</a>.\"</p>\n<p>The problem with this advice is that, for certain kinds of tech/geek minds, the advice is extremely well-optimized for <a href=\"/econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/micfoundrev.doc\">cheaply</a> supporting pleasurable yet useless beliefs -- a kind of <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading\">wireheading</a> that works on your prefrontal cortex instead of directly on your pleasure centers.</p>\n<p>By cheaply, I mean that the beliefs won't really hurt you...it's relatively safe to believe in them. If you believe that traffic in the U.S. drives on the left-hand-side of the street, that's a very expensive belief; no matter happy you are thinking that you, and only you, know the amazing secret of LeftTrafficIsm, you won't get to experience that happiness for very long, because you'll get into an auto accident by tomorrow at the latest. By contrast, believing that your vote in the presidential primaries makes a big difference to the outcome of the election is a relatively cheap belief. You can go around for several years thinking of yourself as an important, empowered, responsible citizen, and all it costs you is a few hours (tops) of waiting in line at a polling station. In both cases, you are objectively and obviously wrong -- but in one case, you 'purchase' a lot of pleasure with a little bit of wrongness, and in the other case, you purchase a little bit of pleasure with a tremendous amount of wrongness.</p>\n<p>Among the general public, one popular cheap belief to 'buy' is that&nbsp;a benevolent, powerful God will take you away to magical happy sunshine-land after you die, if and only if you're a nice person who doesn't commit suicide.&nbsp;As it's stated, indulging in that belief doesn't cost you much in terms of your ability to achieve your other goals, and it gives you something pleasant to think about. This belief is unpopular with the kind of people who are attracted to Less Wrong, <em>even before they get here</em>, because we are much less likely to <a href=\"/lw/1zu/compartmentalization_as_a_passive_phenomenon/\">compartmentalize</a>&nbsp;our beliefs.</p>\n<p>If you have a sufficiently separate compartment for religion, you can believe in heaven without much affecting your belief in evolution. God's up there, bacteria are down here, and that's pretty much the end of it. If you have an integrated, physical, reductionist model of the Universe, though, believing in heaven would be very expensive, because it would undermine your hard-won confidence in lots of other practically useful beliefs. If there are spirits floating around in Heaven somewhere, how do you know there aren't spirits in your water making homeopathy work? If there's a benevolent God watching us, how do you know He hasn't magically guided you to the career that best suits you? And so on. For geeks, believing in heaven is a lousy bargain, because it costs way too much in terms of practical navigation ability to be worth the warm fuzzy thoughts.</p>\n<p>Enter...cryonics and friendly AI. Oh, look! Using only physical, reductionist-friendly mechanisms, we can show that a benevolent, powerful entity whose mind is not centered on any particular point in space (let's call it 'Sysop' instead of God) might someday start watching over us. As an added bonus, as long as we don't commit suicide by throwing our bodies into the dirt as soon as our hearts stop beating, we can wake up in the future using the power of cryonics! The future will be kinder, richer, and generally more fun than the present...much like magical happy sunshine-land is better than Earth.</p>\n<p>Unlike pre-scientific religion, the \"cryonics + Friendly AI\" Sysop story is 'cheap' for people who rarely compartmentalize. You can believe in Sysop without needing to believe in anything that can't be explained in terms of charge, momentum, spin, and other fundamental physical properties. Like pre-scientific religion, the Sysop story is a whole lot of fun to think about and believe in. It makes you happy! That, in and of itself, doesn't make you wrong, but it is very important to stay aware of the <a href=\"/lw/js/the_bottom_line/\">true causes of your beliefs</a>. If you came to believe a relatively strange and complicated idea because it made you happy, it is very unlikely that this same idea just happens to also be strongly entangled with reality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Partisanship\">Partisanship</h2>\n<p>As for dropping out of other religious communities, well, they're the quintessential bad guys, right? Not only do they believe in all kinds of unsubstantiated woo, they suck you into a dense network of personal relationships -- which we at Less Wrong want <a href=\"/lw/4un/towards_a_bay_area_less_wrong_community/\">earnestly</a> to <a href=\"/lw/6ca/community_roles_committees_and_leadership/\">re-create</a>, just, you know, without any of the religion stuff. The less emotional attachment you have to your old community, the more you'll be free and available to help bootstrap ours!</p>\n<p>Why should you spend all your time trying to get one of the first rationalist communities up and running (hard) instead of joining a pre-existing, respectable religious community (easy)? Well, to be fair, there are <a href=\"/lw/4ul/less_wrong_nyc_case_study_of_a_successful/\">lots</a> of good reasons. Depending on how rationalist you are, you might strongly prefer the company of other rationalists, both as people to be intimate with and as people to try to run committee meetings with. If you're naturally different enough from the mainstream, it could be more fun and less frustrating for you to just join up with a minority group, despite the extra effort needed to build it up.</p>\n<p>There is a meme on Less Wrong, though, that rationalist communities are not just better-suited to the unique needs of rationalists, but also better in general. Rationality is the <a href=\"/lw/6cv/entangled_with_reality_the_shoelace_example/\">lens that sees its own flaws</a>. We get along better, get fit faster, have more fun, and know how to do more things well. Through rationality, we learn to <a href=\"/lw/5c0/epistle_to_the_new_york_less_wrongians/\">optimize</a> everything in sight. Rationality should ultimately <a href=\"/lw/4v5/effective_rationality_outreach/\">eat the whole world</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, you have to ask yourself: what are the odds that these beliefs are driven by valid evidence, as opposed to <a href=\"/lw/i7/belief_as_attire/\">ordinary human instincts</a> for supporting their own tribe and denigrating their neighbors? As Eliezer very fairly acknowledges, we don't even have decent metrics for measuring rationality itself, let alone for measuring the real-world effects that rationality supposedly has or will have on people's wealth, health, <a href=\"/lw/5t/can_humanism_match_religions_output/\">altruism</a>, reported happiness, etc.</p>\n<p>Do we *really* identify our own flaws and then act accordingly, or do we just accept the teachings of professional neuroscientists -- who may or may not be rationalists -- and invent just-so stories 'explaining' how our present or future conduct dovetails with those teachings? Take the \"foveal blind spot\" that tricks us into perceiving stars in the night sky as <a href=\"/lw/6cv/entangled_with_reality_the_shoelace_example/\">disappearing</a> when you look straight at them. Do you (or anyone you know) really have the skill to identify a biological human flaw, connect it with an observed phenomenon, and then deviate from conventional wisdom on the strength of your analysis? If mainstream scientists believed that stars don't give off any light that strikes the Earth directly head-on, would you be able to find, digest, and apply the idea of foveal blind spots in order to prove them wrong? If not, do you still think that rationalist communities are better than other communities for intelligent but otherwise ordinary people? Why?</p>\n<p>It would be <em>really convenient</em>&nbsp;if rationality, the meme-cluster that we most enjoy and are best-equipped to participate in, also happened to be the best for winning at life. In case it turns out that life is not quite so convenient, maybe we should be a little humbler about our grand experiment. Even if we have good reason to assert that mainstream religious thinking is flawed, maybe we should be slower to advise people to give up the <a href=\"/lw/4su/how_to_be_happy/\">health benefits</a> (footnote 15) of belonging, emotionally, to one or another religious community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Bullshit\">Bullshit</h2>\n<p>Finally, suppose you publicly declared yourself to have nigh-on-magical powers -- by virtue of this strange thing that few people in your area understand, \"rationality,\" you can make yourself smarter, more disciplined, more fun to be around, and generally awesome-r. Of course, rationality takes time to blossom -- everyone understands that; you make it clear. You do not presently have <a href=\"/lw/y5/the_babyeating_aliens_18/\">big angelic powers</a>, it is just that you will get your hands on them soon.</p>\n<p>A few months go by, maybe a year, and while you have *fascinating* insights into cognitive biases, institutional inefficiencies, and quantum physics, your friends either can't understand them or are bored to tears by your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphaloskepsis\">omphaloskepsis</a>. You need to come up with something that will actually impress them, and soon, or you'll suffer from cognitive dissonance and might have to back off of your pleasurable belief that rationality is better than other belief systems.</p>\n<p>Lo and behold, you discover the amazing benefits of chemical stimulants! Your arcane insights into the flaws of the institutional medical establishment and your amazing ability to try out different experimental approaches and faithfully record which ones work best have allowed you to safely take drugs that the lay world shuns as overly dangerous. These drugs do, in fact, boost your productivity, your apparent energy, and your mood. You appear to be smarter and more fun than those around you who are not on rationally identified stimulants. Chalk one up for rationality.</p>\n<p>Unless, of course, the drugs have undesirable long-term or medium-term effects. Maybe you develop tolerance and have to take larger and larger doses. Maybe you wear out your liver or your kidneys, or lower your bone density. Maybe you mis-underestimate your ability to operate heavy machinery on polyphasic sleep cycles, and drive off the side of the road. Less Wrong is too young, as a meme cluster, for most of these hazards to have been triggered. I wouldn't bet on any one of those outcomes for any one drug...but if your answer to the challenges of life is to self-medicate, you're taking on a whole lot more risk than the present maturity of the discipline of rationality would seem to warrant.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I've tried my best <em>not </em>to frontally engage any of the <em>internal</em>&nbsp;techniques or justifications of rationality. On what Robin Hanson would call an inside view, rationality looks very, very attractive, even to me. By design, I have not argued here that, e.g., it is difficult to revive a frozen human brain, or that the FDA is the best judge of which drugs are safe.</p>\n<p>What I have tried to do instead is imagine rationality and all its parts as a black box, and ask: what goes into it, and what comes out of it? What goes in is a bunch of smart nonconformists. What comes out, at least so far, is some strange advice. The advice pays off on kind of a bimodal curve: cryonics and SIAI pay off at least a decade in the future, if at all, whereas drugs and quitting religion offer excellent rewards now, but may involve heavy costs down the road.</p>\n<p>The relative dearth of s<em>ustainable yet immediate </em>behavioral&nbsp;payoffs coming out of the box leads me to suspect that the people who go into the box go there not so much to learn about superior behaviors, but to learn about superior beliefs. The main sense in which the beliefs are superior in terms of their ability to make tech/geek people think happy thoughts without 'paying' too much in bad outcomes.</p>\n<p>I hold this suspicion with about 30% confidence. That's not enough to make me want to abandon the rationalist project -- I think, on balance, it still makes sense for us to try to figure this stuff out. It <em>is</em> enough for me to want to proceed more carefully. I would like to see an emphasis on low-hanging fruit. What can we safely accomplish this month? this year? I would like to see warnings and disclaimers. Instead of blithely informing everyone else of how awesome we are, maybe we should give a cheerful yet balanced description of the costs and benefits. It's OK to say that we think the benefits outweigh the costs...but, in a 2-minute conversation, the idea of costs should be acknowledged at least once. Finally, I would like to see more emphasis on testing and measuring rationality. I will work on figuring out ways to do this, and if anyone has any good measurement schemes, I will be happy to donate some of my money and/or time to support them.</p>", "sections": [{"title": "Wishful Thinking", "anchor": "Wishful_Thinking", "level": 1}, {"title": "Partisanship", "anchor": "Partisanship", "level": 1}, {"title": "Bullshit", "anchor": "Bullshit", "level": 1}, {"title": "Conclusion", "anchor": "Conclusion", "level": 1}, {"divider": true, "level": 0, "anchor": "postHeadingsDivider"}, {"anchor": "comments", "level": 0, "title": "161 comments"}], "headingsCount": 6}, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 161, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {"Posts": ["9kcTNWopvXFncXgPy", "LgavAYtzFQZKg95WC", "AWZ7butnGwwqyeCuc", "qjSHfbjmSyMnGR9DS", "cPhFhjCxrfoLxxs32", "9vBasHrBtCmC6zAzD", "NZY2eAALzTTuYzR2t", "hiDkhLyN5S2MEjrSE", "yKXKcyoBzWtECzXrE", "EzH64G6k39XwiQCwJ", "qqhdj3W3vSfB5E9ss", "PMr6f7ZocEWFtCYXj", "rZX4WuufAPbN6wQTv", "gfexKxsBDM6v2sCMo", "NYPmCBfrDfXfhwBog", "dW9DTLZcScAPj98eR", "rRmisKb45dN7DK4BW", "kD8uzcmjKwSaTHnQJ", "34XxbRFe54FycoCDw", "N8DaeP83CSgKnjcid", "igkgCjss3rmNmp9jB", "CsKboswS3z5iaiutC", "fKiTt55jEiTFK5prp", "jP583FwKepjiWbeoQ", "67JaiGAe6SuNHKoLk", "nYkMLFpx77Rz3uo9c", "3fNL2ssfvRzpApvdN", "ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9", "n5TqCuizyJDfAPjkr"]}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 1, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-07-07T05:27:31.026Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "[fic idea] Rationalist Gurren Lagann?", "slug": "fic-idea-rationalist-gurren-lagann", "viewCount": null, "lastCommentedAt": "2020-10-30T18:33:17.776Z", "clickCount": null, "deletedDraft": false, "status": 2, "isFuture": false, "sticky": false, "stickyPriority": 2, "userIP": null, "userAgent": null, "referrer": null, "author": null, "user": {"username": "Multiheaded", "createdAt": "2011-07-02T10:10:20.692Z", "isAdmin": false, "displayName": "Multiheaded"}, "userId": "moGiw35FowgiAnzfg", "domain": null, "pageUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XYAQaGAtd5of4BsmK/fic-idea-rationalist-gurren-lagann", "pageUrlRelative": "/posts/XYAQaGAtd5of4BsmK/fic-idea-rationalist-gurren-lagann", "linkUrl": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XYAQaGAtd5of4BsmK/fic-idea-rationalist-gurren-lagann", "postedAtFormatted": "Thursday, July 7th 2011", "emailShareUrl": "mailto:?subject=Interesting%20link%3A%20%5Bfic%20idea%5D%20Rationalist%20Gurren%20Lagann%3F&body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20find%20this%20interesting%3A%0A%0A%5Bfic%20idea%5D%20Rationalist%20Gurren%20Lagann%3F%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FXYAQaGAtd5of4BsmK%2Ffic-idea-rationalist-gurren-lagann%0A%0A(found%20via%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com)%0A%20%20", "twitterShareUrl": "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%5Bfic%20idea%5D%20Rationalist%20Gurren%20Lagann%3F%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FXYAQaGAtd5of4BsmK%2Ffic-idea-rationalist-gurren-lagann", "facebookShareUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FXYAQaGAtd5of4BsmK%2Ffic-idea-rationalist-gurren-lagann", "socialPreviewImageUrl": "", "question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 528, "htmlBody": "<p>(If you don't know what Gurren Lagann is, don't hesitate to google &amp; watch it, unless you have an aversion to anime in general, in which case ignore this altogether.)</p>\n<p>I feel that a fanfic like HPMOR but with Gurren Lagann's setting and characters could be 1) absolutely kickass (given EY-level writing) and 2) in fact better suited to treatises on rationalism, logic and science than Harry Potter. The premise I saw on /a/, an indeterminate time ago, without any connection to HPMOR (hell, it was probably before HPMOR), but it struck me then as surprisingly well-conceived. It went like: \"The heroes relieve the entire history of science, first inventing the scientific method, then examining specific fields, one per arc, for useful and creative stuff to use against the powers-that-be keeping humanity down through their ancient, rigid knowledge.\" Now, this is easy enough to fit into the specific setting of TTGL, first using older tech and basic rationality against Lordgenome, then, after the timeskip, going for current and speculative science to bring down the vastly more powerful but anti-creative Anti-Spirals, ultimately aiming for FAI.

do is to sign an exclusive contract with a real estate agent before they take you to look at houses.</p>\n<p>I spoke to some co-workers, and none of them signed the contracts.&nbsp; I didn't understand:&nbsp; How can you avoid signing a contract, when the real estate agent, whom you must work with for months, will begin every meeting by telling you that the first thing to do is to sign the contract?</p>\n<p>My boss told me that she distracted her agent.&nbsp; Whenever he brought the subject up, she questioned him about details, which led on to other details, until they were in the car and driving to a showing and talking about something else completely.</p>\n<p>This would be a useful skill.&nbsp; And I can't imagine myself pulling it off.&nbsp; Something in my gut would twist, and I would choke on my own words, if I tried to use conversation not to communicate information, but to entrap someone into doing something they didn't want to do by ensuring that they would have to violate social conventions to get out of it.</p>\n<p>(I asked my boss if she'd ever done that to me.&nbsp; She smiled very sweetly and said, \"Never!\")</p>\n<p>And even if I could get over the choking, stuttering, and turning red, I don't think I could keep the game up for an entire hour.&nbsp; I'm inclined to do search, not dynamic control optimization - to play chess (okay, Freecell), not to juggle or do magic tricks.</p>\n<p>Somebody who did have the power to do that would be able to do awesome Jedi mind tricks.&nbsp; (Like, say, pick up women.&nbsp; Is it a coincidence that some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_(pickup_artist)\">pickup</a> <a href=\"http://pumaskills.com/blog/\">artists</a> are also magicians?)</p>\n<p>Are you like me in that way?&nbsp; Are most of us left-brained Spocks who can't even <em>try </em>to lie or manipulate people?&nbsp; I've met a lot of you, and I think the answer is \"yes\", but I really want to see your answers.&nbsp; If so, is it because you choose to be that way, or because you have no choice?&nbsp; What is this personality trait that we don't even have a name for, why is rationality so highly-correlated with it, and what else correlates with it?</p>\n<p>If you think we're being rational to be so rational, say that, too.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http://www.wolfpark.org/\">Wolf Park</a> in Indiana, the biologists, who probably have at least a bit of the nerdy rationalist about them, have developed a technique for dealing with wolves when they're in the enclosure with them.&nbsp; The wolves interact using dominance displays.&nbsp; When humans go into the enclosure, and the wolves realize these same people keep coming back (they ignore visitors), the wolves want to establish the places of these humans in the dominance ladder (pedantic note: ladder, not hierarchy).&nbsp; So they repeatedly try to engage the humans in dominance contests.</p>\n<p>The thing about a dominance contest is that quitting equals losing.&nbsp; You can't opt out of one once it's started (unless you have <em>super</em> Jedi mind skills).&nbsp; Old-school wolf-handling was to become dominant; the problem with that is that, if you ever go into the wolf enclosure on a day when you have a cold, or are depressed, or just not focused on the task at hand, the nice beta wolf you have regarded as your friend for years may leap on your throat and (at best) throw you to the ground.&nbsp; Even if you survive, you would be ill-advised to ever go back into the wolf pen; an alpha, once overthrown, moves (strangely) to the very bottom of the dominance ladder, and is fair game for every wolf in the pack.&nbsp; The no-teaming-up rule which seems to apply to wolf dominance fights (doesn't to primates or felines, BTW) no longer applies.</p>\n<p>It's better to leave the question of dominance unsettled.&nbsp; Just like in the schoolyard, a person with an unknown rank has more leeway than one who is ranked; yet isn't constantly watched for signs of weakness the way an alpha is.&nbsp; (An alpha wolf at Wolf Park once had a lower spinal injury.&nbsp; He must have been in agony, but stayed where he was without whining or moving for 2 days before the humans rescued him - not because he couldn't move, but (we think) to keep the other wolves from noticing anything funny about his movements.)&nbsp; Also, having the alphas be humans disrupts the pack dynamics that the biologists are studying.&nbsp; So the biologists have developed a strategy of distracting the wolves before they can bring up the question of dominance.&nbsp; One person does whatever it is they need to go into the enclosure to do; while the rest of them use toys, food, head-skritching, and tag-team techniques to keep any one wolf from focusing on any one human for long.</p>\n<p>This is a use of the same technique that my boss used, that is practical and ethically laudable.&nbsp; Could you do that?&nbsp; If so, what makes it different?</p>\n<p>I still don't think I could do it.&nbsp; The cognitive load of trying to observe wolves and continually come up with novel distractions would be too great.&nbsp; I don't think I could do it on the fly - at least, not well enough to ask people to bet their lives on it.&nbsp; My mind operates with a long clock cycle.&nbsp; I am <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Instruction_Set_Computer\">CISC</a>, not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer\">RISC</a>.&nbsp; Is that what makes nerds so famously poor at social interaction - that our minds are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI\">GOFAI</a>, not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics\">cybernetics</a>?</p>",

discounting, and picoeconomics</a></p>\n<p>If you're tired of studies where you inevitably get deceived, electric shocked, or tricked into developing a sexual attraction to penny jars, you might want to sign up for Brian Wansink's next experiment. He provided secretaries with a month of unlimited free candy at their workplace. The only catch was that half of them got the candy in a bowl on their desk, and half got it in a bowl six feet away. The deskers ate five candies/day more than the six-footers, which the scientists calculated would correspond to a weight gain of over 10 pounds more per year<sup>1</sup>.<br /><br /><a href=\"/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/\">Beware trivial inconveniences</a> (or, in this case, if you don't want to gain weight, beware the lack of them!) Small modifications to the difficulty of obtaining a reward can make big differences in whether the corresponding behavior gets executed.<br /><strong><br />TIME DISCOUNTING</strong><br /><br />The best studied example of this is time discounting. When offered two choices, where A will lead to a small reward now and B will lead to a big reward later, people will sometimes choose smaller-sooner rather than larger-later depending on the length of the delay and the size of the difference. For example, in one study, people preferred $250 today to $300 in a year; it took a promise of at least $350 to convince them to wait.<br /><br />Time discounting was later found to be \"hyperbolic\", meaning that the discount amount between two fixed points decreases the further you move those two points into the future. For example, you might prefer $80 today to $100 one week from now, but it's unlikely you would prefer $80 in one hundred weeks to $100 in one hundred one weeks. Yet this is offering essentially the same choice: wait an extra week for an extra $20. So it's not enough to say that the discount rate is a constant 20% per week - the discount rate changes depending on what interval of time we're talking about. If you graph experimentally obtained human discount rates on a curve, they form a hyperbola.<br /><br />Hyperbolic discounting creates the unpleasant experience of \"preference reversals\", in which people can suddenly change their mind on a preference as they move along the hyperbola. For example, if I ask you today whether you would prefer $250 in 2019 or $300 in 2020 (a choice between small reward in 8 years or large reward in 9), you might say the $300 in 2020; if I ask you in 2019 (when it's a choice between small reward now and large reward in 1 year), you might say no, give me the $250 now. In summary, people prefer larger-later rewards most of the time EXCEPT for a brief period right before they can get the smaller-sooner reward.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://www.raikoth.net/Stuff/ainslie.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"404\" height=\"307\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://picoeconomics.org/articles.htm\">George Ainslie</a> ties this to akrasia and addiction: call the enjoyment of a cigarette in five minutes the smaller-sooner reward, and the enjoyment of not having cancer in thirty years the larger-later reward. You'll prefer to abstain right up until the point where there's a cigarette in front of you and you think \"I should smoke this\", at which point you will do so.<br /><br />Discounting can happen on any scale from seconds to decades, and it has previously been mentioned that <a href=\"/lw/3kv/working_hurts_less_than_procrastinating_we_fear/\">the second or sub-second level may have disproportionate effects</a> on our actions. Eliezer concentrated on the difficult of changing tasks, but I would add that any task which allows continuous delivery of small amounts of reinforcement with near zero delay can become incredibly addictive even if it isn't all that fun (this is why I usually read all the way through online joke lists, or stay on Reddit for hours). This is also why <a href=\"http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/02/18/distraction-affliction-correction-extensio/\">the XKCD</a> <a href=\"http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/100019\">solution</a> to internet addiction - an extension that makes you wait 30 seconds before loading addictive sites - is so useful.<br /><strong><br />EFFORT DISCOUNTING</strong><br /><br />Effort discounting is time discounting's lesser-known cousin. It's not obvious that it's an independent entity; it's hard to disentangle from time discounting (most efforts usually take time) and from garden-variety balancing benefits against costs (most efforts are also slightly costly). There have really been only one or two <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~matthewb/Publications/BotvinickETAL_CABN09.pdf\">good studies</a> on it and they don't do much more than say it probably exists and has its own signal in the nucleus accumbens.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I expect that effort discounting, like time discounting, will be found to be hyperbolic. Many of these trivial inconveniences involve not just time but effort: the secretaries had to actually stand up and walk six feet to get the candy. If a tiny amount of effort held the same power as a tiny amount of time, it would go even further toward explaining garden-variety procrastination.<br /><br /><strong>TIME/EFFORT DISCOUNTING AND UTILITY</strong><br /><br />Hyperbolic discounting stretches our intuitive notion of \"preference\" to the breaking point.<br /><br />Traditionally, discount rates are viewed as just another preference: not only do I prefer to have money, but I prefer to have it now. But hyperbolic discounting shows that we have no single discount rate: instead, we have different preferences for discount rates at different future times.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~camerer/NYU/03-LowensteinODonoghueFrederick+.pdf\">It gets worse.</a> Time discount rates seem to be different for losses and gains, and different for large amounts vs. small amounts (I gave the example of $250 now being worth $350 in a year, but the same study found that $3000 now is only worth $4000 in a year, and $15 now is worth a whopping $60 in a year). You can even get people to exhibit negative discount rates in certain situations: offer people $10 now, $20 in a month, $30 in two months, and $40 in three months, and they'll prefer it to $40 now, $30 in a month, and so on - maybe because it's nice to think things are only going to get better?<br /><br />Are there utility functions that can account for this sort of behavior? Of course: you can do a lot of things just by adding enough terms to an equation. But what is the \"preference\" that the math is describing? When I say I like having money, that seems clear enough: preferring $20 to $15 is not a separate preference than preferring $406 to $405.<br /><br />But when we discuss time discounting, most of the preferences cited are specific: that I would prefer $100 now to $150 later. Generalizing these preferences, when it's possible at all, takes several complicated equations. Do I really want to discount gains more than losses, if I've never consciously thought about it and I don't consciously endorse it? Sure, there might be such things as unconscious preferences, but saying that the unconscious just loves following these strange equations, in the same way that it loves food or sex or status, seems about as contrived as saying that our robot just really likes switching from blue-minimization to yellow-minimization every time we put a lens on its sensor.<br /><br />It makes more sense to consider time and effort discounting as describing reward functions and not utility functions. The brain estimates the value of reward in neural currency using these equations (or a neural network that these equations approximate) and then people execute whatever behavior has been assigned the highest reward.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Footnotes</strong><br /><br /><strong>1:</strong> Also cited in the same Nutrition Action article: if the candy was in a clear bowl, participants ate on

This is awesome. For newcomers, however, it's quite intimidating. Rather than leave newcomers to figure out which posts are worth reading themselves, we provide some guidance, in the form of suggested reading orders. Previously, this has mainly meant the sequences, which are a list of posts that fit neatly into topics, sorted by topic. Unfortunately, reading in topic-sorted order is less than ideal, and many of Less Wrong's best posts weren't part of any sequence. Therefore, I have put together a suggested reading order: the hundred best posts on Less Wrong, in my purely subjective and unofficial judgment, arranged in a sensible order. Thanks to Student_UK for <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/66u/rewriting_the_sequences/\">pointing out</a> the need to reconsider how Less Wrong's archived content is presented, to XiXiDu for <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/66u/rewriting_the_sequences/4cc0\">creating a reading list</a> and to Academian for <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/User:Academian\">another reading list</a>; my reading list draws on (but is not a strict superset of) both these lists.</p>\n<p><em>This is only a draft</em>. Since the set of posts newcomers read has a significant impact on the community, I am soliciting feedback. After feedback has been collected, I will move (or clone) this list into the wiki, with feedback incorporated. Note that after my first pass, I had more than four hundred candidates for the top hundred; there were many excellent posts that I had to cut, and doubtless many more that I simply overlooked. I used karma as one consideration when deciding what to include, but this list is not karma based. Additional notes about what I did and didn't include at the bottom.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more\"></a>And with all that out of the way, the top five Less Wrong posts that everyone should read:</p>\n<p>Top 5<br /><a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: underline;\">What Do We Mean By \"Rationality\"</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"> by Eliezer_Yudkowsky</span><br /><a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/3nn/scientific_selfhelp_the_state_of_our_knowledge/\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: underline;\">Scientific Self-Help: The State of Our Knowledge</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"> by lukeprog</span><br /><a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/4e/cached_selves/\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: underline;\">Cached Selves</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"> by AnnaSalamon and Steve_Rayhawk</span><br /><a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: underline;\">Efficient Charity: Do Unto Others...</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"> by Yvain</span><a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/im/hindsight_devalues_science/\"></a><a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: underline;\">Making Beliefs Pay Rent (in Anticipated Experiences)</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"> by Eliezer_Yudkowsky</span><br /><a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">A good pace is one or two posts per day, so that you have time to digest and internalize them.

I've tried to include a balanced mix of epistemic rationality, instrumental rationality, and motivations to learn about rationality, spread out through the list, except that the motivations are front-loaded. I have omitted some topics entirely; now that I'm done with the top 100, I will be starting on an \"overflow list\", containing all the posts that deserved to be here but which didn't fit in the top 100. This will include the Quantum Physics, Luminosity, Zombies, and Metaethics sequences, plus skipped portions of the main sequences and probably at least a hundred other miscellaneous posts.</p>\n<p>I am looking for three types of feedback. First: point out if any posts are using concepts without sufficient introduction, so I can change the order to put the introduction in the right place. Second: if there are any posts in this list aren't pulling their weight, that might be profitably replaced with the best of the overflow list, point them out. (Note that a post can meet this criterion and still be excellent.) And third: point out any posts that should be here but aren't, especially posts that introduce concepts or jargon that occur frequently in comments.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true,

false, "wordCount": 1710, "htmlBody": "<p>I'm trying to apply some LessWrong lessons to certain aspects of politics, in order to encourage some people to adopt LW techniques. Yes, I know it's the mind-killer, but it still consists of problems to try to solve... and one of the core difficulties is that for this particular audience, their main focus, 'liberty', is generally treated qualitatively, resulting in much discussion that is more opinion than evidence-based. So I asked myself - is it possible to treat this thing quantitatively, and if so, what would that mean? - resulting in the following exploration:<br /><br /><br />Heinlein wrote:<br /><br />&gt; What are the facts? Again and again and again - what are the facts? Shun<br />&gt; wishful thinking, ignore divine revelation, forget what \"the stars foretell,\" avoid<br />&gt; opinion, care not what the neighbors think, never mind the unguessable<br />&gt; \"verdict of history\" - what are the facts, and to how many decimal places?<br />&gt; You pilot always into an unknown future; facts are your single clue. Get the<br />&gt; facts!<br /><br />Just as the basic scientific method is the bare minimum necessary to advance real knowledge, but there are specific methods within science (such as Bayesian reasoning) that come closer to the ideal of Solomonoff Induction and thus increase knowledge that much faster, it seems plausible that the Zero-Aggression Principle itself is merely the bare minimum necessary to support individuals' freedoms, and that there could be some particular methods within the overall aegis of libertarianism that are better than others at that task.<br /><br />But in order to find out what those methods /are/, we need some way to measure which methods do better - some way to quantify how much freedom an individual has. I don't recall having read anything on the matter in libertarian circles - if work on this has already been done, then I'd be happy to hear about it. But until then, I'll just have to try to muddle through on my own.<br /><br /><br />Yudkowsky wrote:<br /><br />&gt; When there's a confusing problem and you're just starting out and you have a falsifiable<br />&gt; hypothesis, go test it. Find some simple, easy way of doing a basic check and do it<br />&gt; right away. Don't worry about designing an elaborate course of experiments that would<br />&gt; make a grant proposal look impressive to a funding agency. Just check as fast as<br />&gt; possible whether your ideas are false before you start investing huge amounts of effort<br />&gt; in them.<br /><br />So - /is/ there some reasonably simple way of measuring peoples' freedom to do stuff? Some groups have released studies measuring quality of life in different countries, amalgamating various factors into a 'happiness index' or 'quality of life' measurement... and somewhere in there may be something useful.<br /><br />But we /might/ have a set of numbers that are easier to find than that. Looked at one way, the general method used these days to determine how to allocate resources is through 'price' and 'money'; and the more money one has to distribute, the more freedom one has to distribute it to various things. So, in at least one sense, we could try comparing the 'discretionary income' of various groups, which is income minus the costs of the necessities of life (eg, food, shelter, health care, paying taxes to keep out of jail, etc). And, if possible, instead of the mean discretionary income, we'd be better served by the median, that of the average person in that society. For similar reasons, we'd also be better served by calculating the total discretionary income acquired throughout someone's lifetime, than simply looking at the annual figure. If this idea works out, then those groups which tend to be qualitatively higher in respecting individual rights (such as one or more of the sortings listed at https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_freedom_indices ) should at least roughly correspond to having higher median discretionary income. And, if not, then this is yet another wrong idea to replace with a better one.<br /><br />Unfortunately, just because a given metric is chosen doesn't mean that the numbers can be immediately found through Google, in which case you just have to work with whatever closely-related numbers /can/ be found. In this case, the closest I've been able to find so far is http://www.worldsalaries.org/total-personal-income.shtml , which lists about 30 countries by disposable income rather than discretionary. But since discretionary income is at least related to disposable income, we can try checking those 30 countries to their listing on freedom indices to see, as a minimal standard, if the top half of the list has more countries listed as 'free' than the bottom half.<br /><br />(Note - at this point, I /don't know/ what the answer will be. I have a /guess/ - but that guess could turn out to be wrong just as easily as it turns out to be right.)<br /><br /><br />Looking at the data gives us:<br /><br />1st column: Freedom House 2011<br />2nd column: Economic Freedom 2011<br />3rd column: Press Freedom 2010<br />4th column: Democracy Index 2010<br />Good to bad: blue, green, yellow, orange, red<br /><br />US: blue, green, green, blue<br />Switzerland: blue, blue, blue, blue<br />Germany: blue, green, blue, blue<br />UK: blue, green, green, blue<br />Austria: blue, green, blue, blue<br />France: blue, yellow, green, green<br />Netherlands: blue, green, blue, blue<br />Australia: blue, blue, green, blue<br />Taiwan: blue, green, green, green<br />Sweden: blue, green, blue, blue<br />New Zealand: blue, blue, blue, blue<br />Japan: blue, green, green, blue<br />Spain: blue, green, green, blue<br />Korea: blue, yellow, green, blue<br />Hong Kong: yellow, blue, green, orange<br /><br />Singapore: yellow, blue, orange, orange<br />Israel: blue, yellow, yellow, green<br />Russia: red, orange, orange, orange<br />Czech Republic: blue, green, green, blue<br />Latvia: blue, yellow, green, green<br />Slovakia: blue, orange, green, green<br />Brazil: blue, orange, yellow, green<br />Lithuania: blue, green, blue, green<br />Poland: blue, yellow, green, green<br />Thailand: yellow, yellow, orange, green<br />Mexico: yellow, yellow, orange, green<br />China: red, orange, orange, red<br />Romania: blue, yellow, yellow, green<br />Philippines: yellow, orange, orange, green<br /><br />And counting up the columns:<br /><br />1st half: Column 1: 14 blue, 1 yellow, 0 red.<br />2nd half: Column 1: 8 blue, 4 yellow, 2 red<br /><br />1st half: Column 2: 4 blue, 9 green, 2 yellow, 0 orange<br />2nd half: Column 2: 1 blue, 2 green, 7 yellow, 4 orange<br /><br />1st half: Column 3: 6 blue, 9 green, 0 yellow, 0 orange<br />2nd half: Column 3: 1 blue, 4 green, 3 yellow, 6 orange<br /><br />1st half: Column 4: 12 blue, 2 green, 1 orange, 0 red<br />2nd half: Column 4: 1 blue, 10 green, 2 orange, 1 red<br /><br />... so by all four measures, the countries with lower disposable incomes tend to be less free. This means that this idea doesn't /immediately/ fail the sniff test... and so it just might be worth following up on, to see if this continues to be a useful quantification, and if so, what predictions can be made from it that can help guide us as we make plans to increase our freedom. Or perhaps some other measurement will be discovered to be more useful in helping us make such predictions - in which case it would be worthwhile to find /it/.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, what useful ideas can the simple existence of \"lifetime median discretionary income\" as a metric give us?<br /><br />The most obvious is that it when we're faced with a question of what we can do to increase liberty, we know that there are particular actions we can take which will have the /greatest/ benefit, and we can concentrate on identifying them.<br /><br />We can also get at least a rough feel of what some of those actions may involve, which we might not have otherwise thought of.<br /><br />For an obvious example: When someone dies, they no longer receive any income at all; thus, working to prevent deaths, and generally extend lives, helps to increase the total discretionary income those people can accumulate over their lives, and is thus an action promoted by use of this metric - which meshes very well with the standard libertarian view of the Right to Life being rather important. So far, so good.<br /><br />For a counterintuitive example: To calculate discretionary income, both taxes and health care are subtracted from gross income. Reducing taxes means less is taken out of gross, and so is one of the most obvious ways to increase discretionary income. However, /if/ reducing taxes /increases/ the cost of health care by more than the taxes are reduced, then discretionary income will go down - which the use of this metric advises against. What it /does/ advise is to use whatever system results in the /minimum/ cost for health care, whether that cost is paid directly or via taxes (along with some further suggestions about maximizing the benefit-to-cost ratio for health care practices). This perspective goes against the usual grain of libertarian thought, in which taxes are generally viewed as an unalloyed evil... but it may be worth considering what your true goal actually is: increasing liberty /even if/ doing so requires the use of government, or getting rid of government /even if/ doing so reduces individuals' liberty. <br /><br />Perhaps this counterintuitive piece of advice means you think that the metric being used is utterly useless. You are entirely free to think that, and say so however you wish. I am also entirely free to ignore what you say if you simply disparage one metric without suggesting a better one. After all, as Heinlein wrote:<br /><br />&gt; If it can't be expressed in figures, it is not science; it is opinion.</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

href=\"/lw/6j1/find_yourself_a_worthy_opponent_a_chavruta/\">article</a> suggesting that we find \"worthy opponents\" to help us avoid mistakes.</p>\n<p>As you may recall, <a href=\"/lw/1pc/debunking_komponisto_on_amanda_knox_long/\">Rolf Nelson disagrees with me about Amanda Knox</a> -- rather sharply. Of course, the same can be said of lots of other people (if not so much here on Less Wrong). But Rolf isn't your average \"guilter\". Indeed, considering that he speaks fluent <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Bayesian\">Bayesian</a>, is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/donors\">one of the Singularity Institute's largest donors</a>, and is also (as I understand it) signed up for <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cryonics\">cryonics</a>, it's hard to imagine an \"opponent\" more \"worthy\". The Amanda Knox case may not be in the same category of importance as many other issues where Rolf and I probably agree; but my opinion on it is very confident, and it's the opposite of his. If we're both aspiring rationalists, at least one of us is doing something wrong. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>As it turns out, Rolf is <a href=\"/lw/6g0/making_an_amanda_knox_prediction_market/4gp9\">interested in having a debate with me on the subject</a>, to see if one of us can help to <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_to_Actually_Change_Your_Mind\">change the other's mind</a>. I'm setting this post up as an experiment, to see if LW can serve as a suitable venue for such an exercise. I hope it can: Less Wrong is almost unique in the extent to which the social norms governing discussion reflect and coincide with the requirements of personal epistemic rationality. (<a href=\"http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues\">For example:</a>&nbsp;\"Do not believe you do others a favor if you accept their arguments; the favor is to you.\") But I don't think we've yet tried an organized one-on-one debate -- so we'll see how it goes. If it proves too unwieldy or inappropriate for some other reason, we can always move to another venue.</p>\n<p>Although the primary purpose of this post is a one-on-one debate between Rolf Nelson and myself, this is a LW Discussion post like any other, and it goes without saying that others are welcome and encouraged to comment. Just be aware that we, the main protagonists, will try to keep our discussion focused on each other's arguments. (Also, since our subject is an issue where there is already a strong LW consensus, one would prefer to avoid a sort of \"gangup effect\" where lots of people \"pounce\" on the person taking the contrarian position.)</p>\n<p>With that, <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/6k7/experiment_knox_case_debate_with_rolf_nelson/4hfu\">here we go</a>...</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "DuSAWuo2vNuSuctQN", "schemaVersion": 2, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "allVotes": [{"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}, {"voteType": "smallUpvote", "cancelled": false, "isUnvote": false}], "voteCount": 19, "baseScore": 27, "extendedScore": null, "score": 7.381012963823744e-07, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "8503", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": null, "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": null, "canonicalSequenceId": null, "canonicalCollectionSlug": null, "canonicalBookId": null, "canonicalNextPostSlug": null, "canonicalPrevPostSlug": null, "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 18, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": null, "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": null, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 68, "af": false, "version": "1.0.0", "pingbacks": {"Posts": ["AZJhBqBvdMCH4oLSP", "HSC9AXARA65qDPNBm"]}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 0, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": null, "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}, {"createdAt": null, "postedAt": "2011-07-08T09:18:39.846Z", "modifiedAt": null, "url": null, "title": "AI-Box Experiment -

couldn't we?</a> Do we really have to be rational all the time in order to teach rationality?breaking the rules of reality within the realm of a work of fiction and making the protagonists (or the audience if it's a videogame) figure the new rules out for themselves... Actually now that I think of it videogamers are very used to adapting themselves to entirely new sets of physics on a weekly basis... but no-one has ever made them stop and <em>think</em> about it for a while, AFAIK.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I think *Methods of Rationality* does this job pretty well, but it'd be nice if there were more fiction in this style, and not just *fan*fiction at that. Alicorn's *Luminosity* also goes through an itneresting route: it applies rationality to interpersonal relationships, character exploration, group dynamics, and *applied* powers, and a lot of this it does better than *Methods* (which relies quite a lot on archetypes, to the detriment of realism but also for great benefit of glorious awesomeness, and it's kind of a holdover from the source material).&nbsp; But *Luminosity* falls rather short of exploring the deeper theoretical implications of such a world.<br /><br />Note how *none* of these books are for kids. Child psychology is noticeably different from that of a late teen or an adult. There are some concepts they can't even *grasp*. A series of works that would teach them the key rationalist virtues and some rational ways of looking at their environment and improving their lives would be great. I'm not talking about writing books intended towards geeky kids (awesome though such a thing may be), but about teaching rationality in a way that'd be appealing to *all* kids.<br /><br />In that sense, *The Magic Bus* taught us a lot about valuing curiosity, not taking the first possible explanation, and generally having fun discovering the laws of reality... in incredibly unrealistic and science-breaking ways (which were dutifully pointed out in a special section after each episode, in which they generally managed to both make us understand that there was more to the stuff we saw than what they showed us, but that sometimes it was okay to take an Artistic License to get the point across... something people like Sheldon Cooper seem chronically unable to grasp, and I'm told there are people who share those opinions in Real Life...). *My Little Pony: Friendship*, on the .other hand, taught a lot on being rational in facing daily troubles, especially regarding friendship... but, well, here again, the situation is rather mutated by the fact that those are ponies living in a pony world with strange pony rules...<br /><br />This might actually help carry the point across *better*. By making the stories take place in fantastic setting, we avoid the kids superimposing their prejudices, preconceptions and heuristics to the material presented: instead, their minds become more open to new possibilities, and this is a wonderful opening to plant some wonderful Aesops...<br /><br />... Wait, is this an instance of using the Dark Arts to teach the Art then?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm not suggesting <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan\">we be emotionally or creatively repressed</a>, <a href=\"/lw/hp/feeling_rational/\">that has nothing to do with being rational</a>. I just wonder how exactly one can allow themselves artistic license in a way that allows people to have fun learning stuff <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ptitle06aht2lyhttp://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ptitle06aht2ly\">without having the fun bits detracting from the general message.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ah, also, here is one example on how to do it <strong>wrong</strong>, from <em>My Little Pony</em> of all places:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In <em>''<a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic\">My LittlePony Friendship Is Magic</a>''</em>, <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticScience\">research magician</a> Twilight Sparkle disregards repeated observational evidence of <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander\">Pinkie Pie</a>'s \"<a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense\">Pinkie Sense</a>\" because it's not <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic\">Sufficiently Analyzed Magic</a>. Then, under the influence of <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries\">severe repeated head trauma</a> and possible <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurningWithAnger\">stress-induced brain anyeurism</a>, she concludes that it \"<a href=\"/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/\">just makes sense</a>,\" and that you <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsWrong\">just have to choose to believe</a> in things you don't understand.
