A burning itch to know is higher than a solemn vow to pursue truth. To feel the burning itch of curiosity requires both that you be ignorant, and that you desire to relinquish your ignorance. If in your heart you believe you already know, or if in your heart you do not wish to know, then your questioning will be purposeless and your skills without direction. Curiosity seeks to annihilate itself; there is no curiosity that does not want an answer. The glory of glorious mystery is to be solved, after which it ceases to be mystery. Be wary of those who speak of being open-minded and modestly confess their ignorance. </p><p>There is a time to confess your ignorance and a time to relinquish your ignorance.\nThe second virtue is relinquishment. P. C. Hodgell said: \u201cThat which can be destroyed by the truth should be.\u201d[1] Do not flinch from experiences that might destroy your beliefs. The thought you cannot think controls you more than thoughts you speak aloud. Submit yourself to ordeals and test yourself in fire. Relinquish the emotion which rests upon a mistaken belief, and seek to feel fully that emotion which fits the facts. If the iron approaches your face, and you believe it is hot, and it is cool, the Way opposes your fear. If the iron approaches your face, and you believe it is cool, and it is hot, the Way opposes your calm. Evaluate your beliefs first and then arrive at your emotions. Let\n yourself say: \u201cIf the iron is hot, I desire to believe it is hot, and if it is cool, I desire to believe it is cool.\u201d Beware lest you become attached to beliefs you may not want.\n</p><p>The third virtue is lightness. Let the winds of evidence blow you about as though you are a leaf, with no direction of your own. Beware lest you fight a rearguard retreat against the evidence, grudgingly conceding each foot of ground only when forced, feeling cheated. Surrender to the truth as quickly as you can. Do this the instant you realize what you are resisting, the instant you can see from which quarter the winds of evidence are blowing against you. Be faithless to your cause and betray it to a stronger enemy. If you regard evidence as a constraint and seek to free yourself, you sell yourself into the chains of your whims. For you cannot make a true map of a city by sitting in your bedroom with your eyes shut and drawing lines upon paper according to impulse. You must walk through the city and draw lines on paper that correspond to what you see. If, seeing the city unclearly, you think that you can shift a line just a little to the right, just a little to the left, according to your caprice, this is just the same mistake.</p><p>\nThe fourth virtue is evenness. One who wishes to believe says, \u201cDoes the evidence permit me to believe?\u201d One who wishes to disbelieve asks, \u201cDoes the evidence force me to believe?\u201d Beware lest you place huge burdens of proof only on propositions you dislike, and then defend yourself by saying: \u201cBut it is good to be skeptical.\u201d If you attend only to favorable evidence, picking and choosing from your gathered data, then the more data you gather, the less you know. If you are selective about which arguments you inspect for flaws, or how hard you inspect for flaws, then every flaw you learn how to detect makes you that much stupider. If you first write at the bottom of a sheet of paper \n\u201cAnd therefore, the sky is green!\u201d it does not matter what arguments you write above it afterward; the conclusion is already written, and it is already correct or already wrong. To be clever in argument is not rationality but rationalization. Intelligence, to be useful, must be used for something other than defeating itself. Listen to hypotheses as they plead their cases before you, but remember that you are not a hypothesis; you are the judge. Therefore do not seek to argue \nfor one side or another, for if you knew your destination, you would already be there.\n</p><p>The fifth virtue is argument. Those who wish to fail must first prevent their friends from helping them. Those who smile wisely and say \u201cI will not argue\u201d remove themselves from help and withdraw from the communal effort. In argument strive for exact honesty, for the sake of others and also yourself: the part of yourself that distorts what you say to others also distorts your own thoughts. Do not believe you do others a favor if you accept their arguments; the favor is to you. Do not think that fairness to all sides means balancing yourself evenly between positions; truth is not handed out in equal portions before the start of a debate. You cannot move forward on factual questions by fighting with fists or insults. Seek a test that lets reality judge between you.\n</p><p>The sixth virtue is empiricism. The roots of knowledge are in observation and its fruit is prediction. What tree grows without roots? What tree nourishes us without fruit? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound? One says, \u201cYes it does, for it makes vibrations in the air.\u201d Another says,\n\u201cNo it does not, for there is no auditory processing in any brain.\u201d Though they argue, one saying \u201cYes,\u201d and one saying \u201cNo,\u201d the two do not anticipate any different experience of the forest. Do not ask which beliefs to profess, but which experiences to anticipate. Always know which difference of experience you argue about. Do not let the argument wander and become about something else, such as someone\u2019s virtue as a rationalist. Jerry Cleaver said: \u201cWhat does you in is not failure to apply some high-level, intricate, complicated technique. It\u2019s overlooking the basics. Not keeping your eye on the ball.\u201d[2] Do not be blinded by words. When words are subtracted, anticipation remains.\n</p><p>The seventh virtue is simplicity. Antoine de Saint-Exupe\u0301ry said: \u201cPerfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\u201d[3] Simplicity is virtuous in belief, design, planning, and justification. When you profess a huge belief with many details, each additional detail is another chance for the belief to be wrong. Each specification adds to your burden; if you can lighten your burden you must do so. There is no straw that lacks the power to break your back. Of artifacts it is said: The most reliable gear is the one that is designed out of the machine. Of plans: A tangled web\n breaks. A chain of a thousand links will arrive at a correct conclusion if every step is correct, but if one step is wrong it may carry you anywhere. In mathematics a mountain of good deeds cannot atone for a single sin. Therefore, be careful on every step.\n</p><p>The eighth virtue is humility. To be humble is to take specific actions in anticipation of your own errors. To confess your fallibility and then do nothing about it is not humble; it is boasting of your modesty. Who are most humble? Those who most skillfully prepare for the deepest and most catastrophic errors in their own beliefs and plans. Because this world contains many whose grasp of rationality is abysmal, beginning students of rationality win arguments and acquire an exaggerated view of their own abilities. But it is useless to be superior: Life is not graded on a curve. The best physicist in ancient Greece could not calculate the path of a falling apple. There is no guarantee that adequacy is possible given your hardest effort; therefore spare no thought for whether others are doing worse. If you compare yourself to others you will not see the biases that all humans share. To be human is to make ten thousand errors. No one in this world achieves perfection.\n</p><p>The ninth virtue is perfectionism. The more errors you correct in yourself, the more you notice. As your mind becomes more silent, you hear more noise. When you notice an error in yourself, this signals your readiness to seek advancement to the next level. If you tolerate the error rather than correcting it, you will not advance to the next level and you will not gain the skill to notice new errors. In every art, if you do not seek perfection you will halt before taking your first steps. If perfection is impossible that is no excuse for not trying. Hold yourself to the highest standard you can imagine, and look for one still higher. Do not be content with the answer that is almost right; seek one that is exactly right.\n</p><p>The tenth virtue is precision. One comes and says: The quantity is between 1 and 100. Another says: The quantity is between 40 and 50. If the quantity is 42 they are both correct, but the second prediction was more useful and exposed itself to a stricter test. What is true of one apple may not be true of another apple; thus more can be said about a single apple than about all the apples in the world. The narrowest statements slice deepest, the cutting edge \nof the blade. As with the map, so too with the art of mapmaking: The Way is a precise Art. Do not walk to the truth, but dance. On each and every step of that dance your foot comes down in exactly the right spot. Each piece of evidence shifts your beliefs by exactly the right amount, neither more nor less. What is exactly the right amount? To calculate this you must study probability theory. Even if you cannot do the math, knowing that the math exists tells you that the dance step is precise and has no room in it for your whims.\n</p><p>The eleventh virtue is scholarship. Study many sciences and absorb their power as your own. Each field that you consume makes you larger. If you swallow enough sciences the gaps between them will diminish and your knowledge will become a unified whole. If you are gluttonous you will become vaster than mountains. It is especially important to eat math and science which impinge upon rationality: evolutionary psychology, heuristics and biases, social psychology, probability theory, decision theory. But these cannot be the only fields you study. The Art must have a purpose other than itself, or it collapses into infinite recursion.</p><p>\nBefore these eleven virtues is a virtue which is nameless. </p><p>Miyamoto Musashi wrote, in <em>The Book of Five Rings</em>:[4]</p><blockquote><p>\nThe primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy\u2019s cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him. More than anything, you must be thinking of carrying your movement through to cutting him.</p></blockquote><p>\nEvery step of your reasoning must cut through to the correct answer in the same movement. More than anything, you must think of carrying your map through to reflecting the territory.\n</p><p>If you fail to achieve a correct answer, it is futile to protest that you acted with propriety.\n</p><p>How can you improve your conception of rationality? Not by saying to yourself, \u201cIt is my duty to be rational.\u201d By this you only enshrine your mistaken conception. Perhaps your conception of rationality is that it is rational to believe the words of the Great Teacher, and the Great Teacher says, \u201cThe sky is green,\u201d and you look up at the sky and see blue. If you think, \u201cIt may look like the sky is blue, but rationality is to believe the words of the Great Teacher,\u201d you lose a chance to discover your mistake.\n</p><p>Do not ask whether it is \u201cthe Way\u201d to do this or that. Ask whether the sky is blue or green. If you speak overmuch of the Way you will not attain it.\nYou may try to name the highest principle with names such as \u201cthe map that reflects the territory\u201d or \u201cexperience of success and failure\u201d or \u201cBayesian decision theory.\u201d But perhaps you describe incorrectly the nameless virtue. How will you discover your mistake? Not by comparing your description to itself, but by comparing it to that which you did not name.\n</p><p>If for many years you practice the techniques and submit yourself to strict constraints, it may be that you will glimpse the center. Then you will see how all techniques are one technique, and you will move correctly without feeling constrained. Musashi wrote: \u201cWhen you appreciate the power of nature, knowing the rhythm of any situation, you will be able to hit the enemy naturally and strike naturally. All this is the Way of the Void.\u201d</p><p>\nThese then are twelve virtues of rationality:\n</p><p>Curiosity, relinquishment, lightness, evenness, argument, empiricism, simplicity, humility, perfectionism, precision, scholarship, and the void.\n</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"ory-row ory-cell-inner\"><div class=\"ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12\"><div class=\"ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf\"><hr class=\"ory-plugins-content-divider\"></div></div></div><div class=\"ory-row ory-cell-inner\"><div class=\"ory-cell ory-cell-sm-12 ory-cell-xs-12\"><div class=\"ory-cell-inner ory-cell-leaf\"><div><h6>1.

"question": false, "authorIsUnreviewed": false, "wordCount": 810, "htmlBody": "<p>I often use the metaphor that rationality is the martial art of mind. You don\u2019t need huge, bulging muscles to learn martial arts\u2014there\u2019s a tendency toward more athletic people being more likely to learn martial arts, but that may be a matter of <em>enjoyment</em> as much as anything else. If you have a hand, with tendons and muscles in the appropriate places, then you can learn to make a fist. </p>\n\n  <p>Similarly, if you have a brain, with cortical and subcortical areas in the appropriate places, you might be able to learn to use it properly. If you\u2019re a fast learner, you might learn faster\u2014but the art of rationality isn\u2019t about that; it\u2019s about training brain machinery we all have in common. And where there are systematic errors human brains tend to make\u2014like an insensitivity to scope\u2014rationality is about fixing those mistakes, or finding work-arounds.</p>\n\n  <p>Alas, our minds respond less readily to our will than our hands. Our ability to control our muscles is evolutionarily ancient; our ability to reason about our own reasoning processes is a much more recent innovation. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised, then, that muscles are easier to use than brains. But it is not wise to neglect the latter training because it is more difficult. It is not by bigger muscles that the human species rose to prominence upon Earth.</p>\n\n  <p>If you live in an urban area, you probably don\u2019t need to walk very far to find a martial arts dojo. Why aren\u2019t there dojos that teach rationality?</p>\n\n  <p>One reason, perhaps, is that it\u2019s harder to verify skill. To rise a level in Tae Kwon Do, you might need to break a board of a certain width. If you succeed, all the onlookers can see and applaud. If you fail, your teacher can watch how you shape a fist, and check if you shape it correctly. If not, the teacher holds out a hand and makes a fist correctly, so that you can observe how to do so.</p>\n\n  <p>Within martial arts schools, techniques of muscle have been refined and elaborated over generations. Techniques of rationality are harder to pass on, even to the most willing student.</p>\n\n  <p>Very recently\u2014in just the last few decades\u2014the human species has acquired a great deal of new knowledge about human rationality. The most salient example would be the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristics_in_judgment_and_decision-making\">heuristics and biases</a> program in experimental psychology. There is also the <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Bayesian\">Bayesian</a> systematization of probability theory and statistics; evolutionary psychology; social psychology. Experimental investigations of empirical human psychology; and theoretical probability theory to interpret what our experiments tell us; and evolutionary theory to explain the conclusions. These fields give us new focusing lenses through which to view the landscape of our own minds. With their aid, we may be able to see more clearly the muscles of our brains, the fingers of thought as they move. We have a shared vocabulary in which to describe problems and solutions. Humanity may finally be ready to synthesize the martial art&nbsp;of mind: to refine, share, systematize, and pass on techniques of personal rationality.</p>\n\n  <p>Such understanding as I have of rationality, I acquired in the course of wrestling with the challenge of artificial general intelligence (an endeavor which, to actually succeed, would require sufficient mastery of rationality to build a complete working rationalist out of toothpicks and rubber bands). In most ways the AI problem is enormously more demanding than the personal art of rationality, but in some ways it is actually easier. In the martial art of mind, we need to acquire the realtime procedural skill of pulling the right levers at the right time on a large, pre-existing thinking machine whose innards are not end-user-modifiable. Some of the machinery is optimized for evolutionary selection pressures that run directly counter to our declared goals in using it. Deliberately we decide that we want to seek only the truth; but our brains have hardwired support for rationalizing falsehoods. We can try to compensate for what we choose to regard as flaws of the machinery; but we can\u2019t actually rewire the neural circuitry. Nor may martial artists plate titanium over their bones\u2014not today, at any rate.</p>\n\n  <p>Trying to synthesize a personal art of rationality, using the science of rationality, may prove awkward: One imagines trying to invent a martial art using an abstract theory of physics, game theory, and human anatomy.</p>\n\n  <p>But humans arent reflectively blind. We do have a native instinct for introspection. The inner eye isnt sightless, though it sees blurrily, with systematic distortions. We need, then, to <em>apply</em> the science to our intuitions, to use the abstract knowledge to <em>correct</em> our mental movements and <em>augment</em> our metacognitive skills. </p>\n\n  <p>We aren't writing a computer program to make a string puppet execute martial arts forms; it is our own mental limbs that we must move. Therefore we must connect theory to practice. We must come to see what the science means, for ourselves, for our daily inner life.</p>\n\n", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null,

"wordCount": 867, "htmlBody": "<p>The goal of instrumental rationality mostly speaks for itself. Some commenters have wondered, on the other hand, why rationalists care about truth. Which invites a few different answers, depending on who you ask; and these different answers have differing characters, which can shape the search for truth in different ways.</p><p>You might hold the view that pursuing truth is inherently noble, important, and worthwhile. In which case your priorities will be determined by your ideals about which truths are most important, or about when truthseeking is most virtuous.</p><p>This motivation tends to have a moral character to it. If you think it your duty to look behind the curtain, you are a lot more likely to believe that someone <i>else</i> should look behind the curtain too, or castigate them if they deliberately close their eyes.</p><p>I tend to be suspicious of morality as a motivation for rationality, <i>not</i> because I reject the moral ideal, but because it invites certain kinds of trouble. It is too easy to acquire, as learned moral duties, modes of thinking that are dreadful missteps in the dance.</p><p>Consider Spock, the naive archetype of rationality. Spock's affect is always set to \u201ccalm,\u201d even when wildly inappropriate. He often gives many significant digits for probabilities that are grossly uncalibrated.<sup>1</sup> Yet this popular image is how many people conceive of the duty to be \u201crational\u201d\u2014small wonder that they do not embrace it wholeheartedly.</p><p>To make rationality into a moral duty is to give it all the dreadful degrees of freedom of an arbitrary tribal custom. People arrive at the wrong answer, and then indignantly protest that they acted with propriety, rather than learning from their mistake.</p><p>What other motives are there?</p><p>Well, you might want to accomplish some specific real-world goal, like building an airplane, and therefore you need to know some specific truth about aerodynamics. Or more mundanely, you want chocolate milk, and therefore you want to know whether the local grocery has chocolate milk, so you can choose whether to walk there or somewhere else.</p><p>If this is the reason you want truth, then the priority you assign to your questions will reflect the expected utility of their information\u2014how much the possible answers influence your choices, how much your choices matter, and how much you expect to find an answer that changes your choice from its default.</p><p>To seek truth merely for its instrumental value may seem impure\u2014should we not desire the truth for its own sake?\u2014but such investigations are extremely important because they create an outside criterion of verification: if your airplane drops out of the sky, or if you get to the store and find no chocolate milk, its a hint that you did something wrong. You get back feedback on which modes of thinking work, and which don't.</p><p>Another possibility: you might care about whats true because, damn it, you're <i>curious</i>.</p><p>As a reason to seek truth, curiosity has a special and admirable purity. If your motive is curiosity, you will assign priority to questions according to how the questions, themselves, tickle your aesthetic sense. A trickier challenge, with a greater probability of failure, may be worth more effort than a simpler one, just because it's more fun.</p><p>Curiosity and morality can both attach an intrinsic value to truth. Yet being curious about whats behind the curtain is a very different state of mind from believing that you have a moral duty to look there. If you're curious, your priorities will be determined by which truths you find most intriguing, not most important or most useful.</p><p>Although pure curiosity is a wonderful thing, it may not linger too long on verifying its answers, once the attractive mystery is gone. Curiosity, as a human emotion, has been around since long before the ancient Greeks. But what set humanity firmly on the path of Science was noticing that certain modes of thinking uncovered beliefs that let us <i>manipulate the world</i>\u2014truth as an instrument. As far as sheer curiosity goes, spinning campfire tales of gods and heroes satisfied that desire just as well, and no one realized that anything was wrong with that.</p><p>At the same time, if we're going to improve our skills of rationality, go beyond the standards of performance set by hunter-gatherers, we'll need deliberate beliefs about how to think\u2014things that look like norms of rationalist \u201cpropriety.\u201d When we write new mental programs for ourselves, they start out as explicit injunctions, and are only slowly (if ever) trained into the neural circuitry that underlies our core motivations and habits.</p><p>Curiosity, pragmatism, and quasi-moral injunctions are all key to the rationalist project. Yet if you were to ask me which of these is most foundational, I would say: \u201ccuriosity.\u201d I have my principles, and I have my plans, which may well tell me to look behind the curtain. But then, I also just really want to know. What will I see? The world has handed me a puzzle, and a solution feels tantalizingly close.</p><hr><p><sup>1</sup> E.g., \u201cCaptain, if you steer the Enterprise directly into that black hole, our probability of surviving is only 2.234%.\u201d Yet nine times out of ten the <i>Enterprise</i> is not destroyed. What kind of tragic fool gives four significant digits for a figure that is off by two orders of magnitude?</p>", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false,

availability bias is at work. Scope insensitivity is another example of a <em>cognitive bias</em>. </p>\n\n  <p>\u201cCognitive biases\u201d are those obstacles to truth which are produced, not by the cost of information, nor by limited computing power, but by <em>the shape of our own mental machinery</em>. For example, our mental processes might be evolutionarily adapted to specifically believe some things that arent true, so that we could win political arguments in a tribal context. Or the mental machinery might be adapted not to particularly care whether something is true, such as when we feel the urge to believe what others believe to get along socially. Or the bias may be a side-effect of a useful reasoning heuristic. The availability heuristic is not itself a bias, but it gives rise to them; the machinery uses an algorithm (give things more evidential weight if they come to mind more readily) that does some good cognitive work but also produces systematic errors. </p>\n\n  <p>Our brains are doing something wrong, and after a lot of experimentation and/or heavy thinking, someone identifies the problem verbally and concretely; then we call it a \u201c(cognitive) bias.\u201d Not to be confused with the colloquial \u201cthat person is biased,\u201d which just means \u201cthat person has a skewed or prejudiced attitude toward something.\u201d</p>\n\n  <p>In cognitive science, \u201cbiases\u201d are distinguished from errors that arise from <em>cognitive content</em>, such as learned false beliefs. These we call \u201cmistakes\u201d rather than \u201cbiases,\u201d and they are much easier to correct, once we\u2019ve noticed them for ourselves. (Though the source of the mistake, or the source of the source of the mistake, may ultimately be some bias.) </p>\n\n  <p>\u201cBiases\u201d are also distinguished from errors stemming from damage to an individual human brain, or from absorbed cultural mores; biases arise from machinery that is humanly universal.</p>\n\n  <p>Plato wasn\u2019t \u201cbiased\u201d because he was ignorant of General Relativity\u2014he had no way to gather that information, his ignorance did not arise from the shape of his mental machinery. But if Plato believed that philosophers would make better kings because he himself was a philosopher\u2014and this belief, in turn, arose because of a universal adaptive political instinct for self-promotion, and not because Plato\u2019s daddy told him that everyone has a moral duty to promote their own profession to governorship, or because Plato sniffed too much glue as a kid\u2014then that was a bias, whether Plato was ever warned of it or not.</p>\n\n  <p>While I am not averse (as you can see) to discussing definitions, I don\u2019t want to suggest that the project of better wielding our own minds rests on a particular choice of terminology. If the term \u201ccognitive bias\u201d turns out to be unhelpful, we should just drop it.</p>\n\n  <p>We don\u2019t start out with a moral duty to \u201creduce bias,\u201d simply because biases are bad and evil and Just Not Done. This is the sort of thinking someone&nbsp;might end up with if they acquired a deontological duty of \u201crationality\u201d by social osmosis, which leads to people trying to execute techniques without appreciating the reason for them. (Which is bad and evil and Just Not Done, according to <em>Surely You\u2019re Joking, Mr. Feynman</em>, which I read as a kid.) A bias is an obstacle to our goal of obtaining truth, and thus <em>in our way</em>. </p>\n\n  <p>We are here to pursue the great human quest for truth: for we have desperate need of the knowledge, and besides, we're curious. To this end let us strive to overcome whatever obstacles lie in our way, whether we call them \u201cbiases\u201d or not.</p>\n\n", "submitToFrontpage": true, "hiddenRelatedQuestion": false, "originalPostRelationSourceId": null, "shortform": false, "canonicalSource": null, "nominationCount2018": null, "nominationCount2019": 0, "reviewCount2018": null, "reviewCount2019": null, "reviewCount": 0, "reviewVoteCount": 0, "positiveReviewVoteCount": 0, "reviewVoteScoreAF": null, "reviewVotesAF": null, "reviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "reviewVotesHighKarma": null, "reviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "reviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesHighKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVotesAllKarma": null, "finalReviewVoteScoreAF": null, "finalReviewVotesAF": null, "lastCommentPromotedAt": null, "tagRelevance": {"Ng8Gice9KNkncxqcj": 3, "4R8JYu4QF2FqzJxE5": 11}, "noIndex": null, "rsvps": null, "activateRSVPs": null, "nextDayReminderSent": null, "onlyVisibleToLoggedIn": null, "onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts": null, "votingSystem": null, "myEditorAccess": "none", "_id": "jnZbHi873v9vcpGpZ", "schemaVersion": 1, "currentUserVote": null, "currentUserExtendedVote": null, "voteCount": 124, "baseScore": 126, "extendedScore": null, "score": 0.000158, "legacy": true, "legacyId": "601", "legacySpam": null, "feedId": null, "feedLink": null, "lastVisitedAt": null, "isRead": false, "curatedDate": null, "metaDate": null, "suggestForCuratedUsernames": null, "suggestForCuratedUserIds": null, "frontpageDate": "2018-01-30T00:32:03.501Z", "collectionTitle": null, "coauthorUserIds": null, "socialPreviewImageId": null, "socialPreviewImageAutoUrl": "", "canonicalSequenceId": "5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM", "canonicalCollectionSlug": "rationality", "canonicalBookId": "PYQ2izdfDPTe5uJTG", "canonicalNextPostSlug": "burdensome-details", "canonicalPrevPostSlug": "availability", "unlisted": false, "disableRecommendation": null, "defaultRecommendation": null, "draft": null, "meta": false, "hideFrontpageComments": false, "maxBaseScore": 126, "scoreExceeded2Date": "2018-09-30T18:41:30.668Z", "scoreExceeded30Date": "2019-06-30T00:49:30.116Z", "scoreExceeded45Date": "2018-09-30T18:41:30.668Z", "scoreExceeded75Date": "2020-02-16T09:58:22.461Z", "scoreExceeded125Date": "2022-05-11T00:45:55.822Z", "scoreExceeded200Date": null, "bannedUserIds": null, "commentsLocked": null, "organizerIds": null, "groupId": null, "eventType": null, "isEvent": false, "reviewedByUserId": "XtphY3uYHwruKqDyG", "reviewForCuratedUserId": null, "startTime": null, "localStartTime": null, "endTime": null, "localEndTime": null, "eventRegistrationLink": null, "joinEventLink": null, "onlineEvent": null, "globalEvent": null, "mongoLocation": null, "googleLocation": null, "location": null, "contactInfo": null, "facebookLink": null, "meetupLink": null, "website": null, "eventImageId": null, "types": null, "metaSticky": false, "sharingSettings": null, "shareWithUsers": null, "linkSharingKey": null, "linkSharingKeyUsedBy": null, "commentSortOrder": "postCommentsOld", "hideAuthor": false, "tableOfContents": null, "showModerationGuidelines": false, "moderationStyle": null, "hideCommentKarma": null, "commentCount": 16, "af": false, "version": "2.1.0", "pingbacks": {}, "moderationGuidelinesVersion": null, "customHighlightVersion": null, "afDate": null, "afBaseScore": 2, "afExtendedScore": null, "afCommentCount": null, "afLastCommentedAt": "2006-11-27T01:50:34.000Z", "afSticky": false, "suggestForAlignmentUserIds": null, "reviewForAlignmentUserId": null}]
